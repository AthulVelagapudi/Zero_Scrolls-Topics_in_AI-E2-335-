Story:
AMBITION




   By WILLIAM L. BADE




   Illustrated by L. WOROMAY




   To the men of the future, the scientific


   goals of today were as incomprehensible


   as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!






   There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his
 eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from
 the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential
 section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination
 of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.




   What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come
 from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a
 chair, or—




   Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland
 started to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his
 brain....




   This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through
 the window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds
 somewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of
 stretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he
 froze, looking up—for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He
 turned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.






    This wasn't his room!






   The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and
 the shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green
 ocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This
 wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen
 plant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden
 beneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.




   Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.
 His breathing quickened.


    Now


   he remembered what had happened during
 the night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and
 then—what? Blackout....




   Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?




   He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As
 a member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed
 information that other military powers would very much like to obtain.
 It was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from
 the heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done
 it. How?






   He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in
 the details, he had the impression that there was something wrong
 about it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no
 straight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in
 featureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal,
 half ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table,
 built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression
 of arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish
 design, something about the room still was not right.




   His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer
 one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this
 one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He
 pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at
 the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.




   There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of
 causing it to open.




   Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window—and
 realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.




   It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....




   Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently
 banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then
 reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff
 so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!
 Glass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he
 hadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.




   He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character
 of the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became
 aware that he was hungry.




   Where the devil could this place be? And—muscles tightened about his
 empty stomach—what was in store for him here?




   He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless,
 until a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew
 his attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his
 eyes to see what it was.




   A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they
 had been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his
 neck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.




   Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he
 didn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time
 of year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look
 Scandinavian....




   As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans
 and showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained
 for years with weights. They vanished below his field of view,
 presumably into the building.




   He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.






   About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the
 wall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and
 sandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood
 up and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he
 made an unimpressive figure.




   The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed
 were the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.
 The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from
 swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.




   This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of
 himself.




   Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head
 of a thinker, the body of a trained athlete—an unusual combination.




   Impassively, the man said, "My name is Swarts. You want to know where
 you are. I am not going to tell you." He had an accent, European, but
 otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth
 to protest, but Swarts went on, "However, you're free to do all the
 guessing you want." Still there was no suggestion of a smile.




   "Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have
 three meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to
 leave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in
 any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that
 we want your childish secrets about rocket motors." Maitland's heart
 jumped. "My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I
 want to give you some psychological tests...."




   "Are you crazy?" Maitland asked quietly. "Do you realize that at this
 moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll
 admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here—but it
 seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give
 your tests to."




   Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. "They won't find you," he said. "Now,
 come with me."






   After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather
 commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and
 a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple
 of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal
 complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran
 across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the
 center of the room.




   "Lie down," Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,
 "Understand one thing—the more you cooperate, the easier things will
 be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results
 against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make
 me."




   "What's the idea?" Maitland asked. "What is all this?"




   Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an
 answer, but to find the proper words. "You can think of it as a lie
 detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I
 give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down."




   Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed
 muscles. "Make me."




   If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. "That was the first test,"
 he said. "Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if
 you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus."




   Maitland shook his head stubbornly.




   "I see," Swarts said. "You want to find out what you're up against."




   He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the
 solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.
 He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on
 the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across
 his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a
 clamp that held his head immovable.








   Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and
 to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to
 the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung
 from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around
 his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box
 clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined
 the others.




   So—Maitland thought—Swarts could record changes in his skin
 potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of
 the body to stimuli.




   The question was, what were the stimuli to be?




   "Your name," said Swarts, "is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four
 years old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly
 as applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to
 question you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is
 Madison, Wisconsin...."




   "You seem to know everything about me," Maitland said defiantly,
 looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. "Why this recital?"




   "I do not know everything about you—yet. And I'm testing the
 equipment, calibrating it to your reactions." He went on, "Your
 favorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science
 fiction. Maitland,


    how would you like to go to the Moon


   ?"




   Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and
 he tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. "What do
 you mean?"




   Swarts was chuckling. "I really hit a semantic push-button there,
 didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants
 to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out


    why


   ."






   In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid
 aside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for
 several seconds.




   She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that
 glowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of
 blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless
 blouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her
 body, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what
 seemed to be white wool.




   She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like
 expectancy. Maitland sighed and said, "Hello," then glanced down
 self-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.








   She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak
 billowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed
 door for a minute after she was gone.




   Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded
 carrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his
 stomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset
 and to think.




   There were three questions for which he required answers before he
 could formulate any plan or policy.




   Where was he?




   Who was Swarts?




   What was the purpose of the "tests" he was being given?




   It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme
 for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the
 contrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the
 appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been
 nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from
 foreign intelligence officers.




   It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at
 the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to
 think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there
 was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be
 cultivated, not allowed to go to grass.




   This might be somewhere in Africa....




   He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued
 glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get
 hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.
 After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,
 a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,
 Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of
 peace and an undefinable longing.




   Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.




   Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the
 constellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he
 had watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,
 its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the
 horizon, and loved it equally in its


    alter ego


   of morning star. Venus
 was an old friend. An old friend....




   Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and
 diffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists
 clenched, forgetting to breathe.




   Last night Venus hadn't been there.




   Venus was a morning star just now....






    Just now!






   He realized the truth in that moment.






   Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,
 he lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't
 have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.
 Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the
 psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what
 they purported to be.




   Only one question of importance remained:




   What year was this?




   He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of
 jubilation and excitement. The


    future


   ! Here was the opportunity for
 the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.




   Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering
 cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.
 Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked
 beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of
 Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars
 and returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel
 could reach the stars!




   And


    he


   had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend
 his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the
 challenging spaceways between the solar worlds.




   "I'm adaptable," he told himself gleefully. "I can learn fast. There'll
 be a job for me out there...."






    If—






   Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat
 in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a
 way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man
 realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still
 wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The
 fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,
 but—




   After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.






   He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He
 rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the
 evening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell
 of bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except
 that she had discarded the white cloak.




   As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,
 carrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her
 with the word, "Miss!"




   She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.




   "Miss, do you speak my language?"




   "Yes," hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last
 consonant.




   "Miss," he asked, watching her face intently, "what year is this?"




   Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing
 forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her
 shoulder, "You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you."




   "Wait! You mean you don't know?"




   She shook her head. "I cannot tell you."




   "All right; we'll let it go at that."




   She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.






   Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned
 offensive.




   "What year is this?"




   Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. "You know what the date is," he
 stated.




   "No, I don't. Not since yesterday."




   "Come on," Swarts said patiently, "let's get going. We have a lot to
 get through this morning."




   "I


    know


   this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.
 Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an
 evening star."




   "Never mind that. Come."




   Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the
 laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach
 the instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started
 saying a list of words—doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction
 test—Maitland began the job of integrating "csc
   3
   x dx" in his head.
 It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent
 tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts
 had stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man
 standing over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.




   "What year is this?" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.




   "We'll try another series of tests."




   It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He
 lowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks
 of a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at
 the ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's
 eyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.




   "These will keep you from holding your eyes shut," he said. "You can
 blink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down
 against the tension."




   He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears—




   And then the show began.




   He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were
 footsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,
 and outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a
 twelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, "Now I've got you, you
 wife-stealer!" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.
 There was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless
 powder—then blackness.




   With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to
 slow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test—what was the
 countermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them
 declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.




   Now he was looking at a girl. She....




   Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.




   He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day
 after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had
 all the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no
 more. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of
 Swarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this
 new world.




   Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened
 against the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his
 forehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....




   The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.
 There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and
 swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.




   The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his
 eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at
 him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was
 starting to ache from the effort of blinking.




   "What year is this?" he asked.




   "All right," Swarts said. "A.D. 2634."




   Maitland's smile became a grin.






   "I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies," Swarts said
 a while later. "Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.
 If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions."'




   "Ching?"




   "Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals."




   Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector
 to his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.




   That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit
 and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes
 whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering
 one leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme
 over and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant
 mounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth
 Symphony.




   He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself
 aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis
 Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.
 In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright
 globe against the constellations....




   Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray
 of food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and
 revealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.




   "I think you are wonderful," she laughed. "You get everything you
 want, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little
 of what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th
 Century. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me." She
 laughed again, hands on her rounded hips. "I have never seen him so
 irritated as he was this noon."




   Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.
 Eagerly he asked, "Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?
 Believe me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a
 lot better."




   She shrugged. "Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of
 Technology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,
 I think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more
 exciting...."




   "How do you mean—" Maitland wrinkled his brow—"adapt to modern
 culture? Don't tell me


    you're


   from another time!"




   "Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head
 of a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much
 behind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old
 tongue."






   He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of
 Oriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, "Maybe
 I shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look
 altogether like the Norwegians of my time."




   His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely
 unjustified. She merely laughed and said, "There has been much
 history since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by
 Pan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European
 or Asiatic." She giggled. "Swarts' ancestors from your time must be
 cursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but
 one of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is
 Lassisi Swarts."




   Maitland wrinkled his brow. "Afrikander?"




   "The South Africans." Something strange came into her eyes. It might
 have been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. "The Pan-Orientals
 eventually conquered all the world, except for North America—the
 last remnant of the American World Empire—and southern Africa. The
 Afrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and
 they had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They
 had a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified
 of being encircled." She sighed. "They ruled the next world empire and
 it was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.
 That went into the history books as the War of Annihilation."




   "So many? How?"




   "They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies
 of them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot
 factories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever." She gave a little
 shudder.




   "And yet they founded modern civilization," she added. "The grandsons
 of the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot
 production system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands
 raising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,
 either, before the population was—reduced to three hundred million."




   "Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?"






   She shook her head. "There are no more Afrikanders."




   "Rebellion?"




   "No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt
 behind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate
 expiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one
 race now. No more masters or slaves."




   They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. "Let us not
 talk about them any more."




   "Robot factories and farms," Maitland mused. "What else? What means of
 transportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?"




   "Inter-what?"




   "Have men visited the stars?"




   She shook her head, bewildered.




   "I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack," he agreed.
 "But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life
 on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?"




   He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. "I don't
 understand. Mars? What are Mars?"




   After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the
 matter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. "Surely
 you have space travel?"




   She frowned and shook her head. "What does that mean—space travel?"




   He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. "A
 civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories
 wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!"




   "A


    ship


   ? Oh, you mean something like a


    vliegvlotter


   . Why, no, I
 don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a
 thing like that?"




   He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her
 arms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. "Let's get this
 perfectly clear," he said, more harshly than he realized. "So far as
 you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is
 that right?"




   She nodded apprehensively. "I have never heard of it being done."




   He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he
 looked up and said bitterly, "You're looking at a man who would give
 his life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I
 would when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will."






   The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders
 and fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes
 and looked at her. "I just don't understand," he said. "It seemed
 obvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd
 do it."




   Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he
 was facing her. "I've got to understand. I've got to know


    why


   . What
 happened? Why don't men want the planets any more?"




   "Honestly," she said, "I did not know they ever had." She hesitated.
 "Maybe you are asking the wrong question."




   He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.




   "I mean," she explained, "maybe you should ask why people in the 20th
 Century


    did


   want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit."




   Maitland felt his face become hot. "Men can go anywhere, if they want
 to bad enough."




   "But


    why


   ?"




   Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick
 to logic. "Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to
 the population problem...."




   "We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that
 the key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic
 system was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we
 have held the number at that."




   "Birth control," Maitland scoffed. "How do you make it work—secret
 police?"




   "No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we
 cherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those
 two are the best children we could possibly produce...."




   She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. "You understand, what
 I have been saying applies to


    most


   of the world. In some places like
 Aresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I
 belong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of
 them."




   "Even," he said, "granting that you have solved the population problem,
 there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must
 be men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in
 your blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's
 there and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested
 in finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of
 Venus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance
 of only two hundred thousand miles?" His hands were trembling as he
 stopped.




   She shrugged her shapely shoulders. "Go into the past—yes! But go out
 there? I still cannot see why."




   "Has the spirit of adventure


    evaporated


   from the human race, or


    what


   ?"




   She smiled. "In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts
 killed the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time

    Man


   . We are terribly interested in what
 can be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying
 human rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the
 life and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the
 Universe. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets."
