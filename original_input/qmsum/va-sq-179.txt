Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: Ah , pinball .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh .
Marketing: Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Very good .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: Mine . Oh , great .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Huh . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Large .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .
Marketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .
User Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .
User Interface: Uh , well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .
User Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .
Project Manager: Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: So , uh how {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like this .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .
Project Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .
Marketing: Yes .
User Interface: Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
User Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Okay . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours .
User Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .
Project Manager: No , it's not flower power .
User Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: S okay .
User Interface: Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: That was that .
Project Manager: Thank you . So , you're next .
Industrial Designer: I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,
Marketing: {gap} Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh {gap} it won't have to burst uh like in the {disfmarker} in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons
Marketing: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: uh if you {gap} push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs .
Marketing: Yep .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
Marketing: Yeah . But , thi i uh {disfmarker} This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,
Industrial Designer: Not with an L_C_D_ .
Marketing: not .
Project Manager: No , isn't .
Industrial Designer: No .
Project Manager: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .
Project Manager: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you don't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Th then you'll see it on the television .
Project Manager: Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll .
Industrial Designer: but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah
Project Manager: but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No . The television must do that . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes . But that won't be a problem . I think .
Project Manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
Industrial Designer: No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'Cause it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's important .
Marketing: I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .
Industrial Designer: That's true .
Marketing: And that might uh bring back the costs uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But then we'll {disfmarker} I think we must discuss who {disfmarker} uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .
Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: I can uh look on my uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very important .
Industrial Designer: {gap} Uh {disfmarker} Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
Project Manager: Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Doesn't say . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .
User Interface: Hmm .
Marketing: Huh .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: That's from my manufacturing division .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'Kay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well , thank you .
Industrial Designer: Yes ?
Marketing: My turn ?
Project Manager: Next .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm . So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . {vocalsound} 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend {disfmarker} uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's {disfmarker} it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be {disfmarker} uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .
Industrial Designer: Changing covers . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . Any questions ?
Industrial Designer: Nope .
Project Manager: No . It's clear .
User Interface: No .
Project Manager: So now , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide {vocalsound} Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at {disfmarker} 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So {disfmarker} Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface .
Industrial Designer: Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes , a concept on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but if I paint with {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I'll paint . Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Something like this ? Or {disfmarker} Shapes or {disfmarker} What do we need ?
User Interface: Mm , yes . What ?
Marketing: Can make several uh concepts .
Project Manager: Yes , okay .
Marketing: We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: More like something {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah I I I uh {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: M like {disfmarker} Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it .
Project Manager: And you have to .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I have to .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I'm not a designer . It's more {gap} three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's like a gun . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: A g {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , it has to be soft ?
Marketing: Mm . {gap} .
Industrial Designer: And it has to be soft , yeah .
Project Manager: Okay . And uh , the buttons ?
Industrial Designer: So , you can squeeze in it and {disfmarker} Sorry ?
Project Manager: Buttons .
Industrial Designer: Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No , it won't .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
Industrial Designer: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine .
User Interface: Yeah , okay .
Project Manager: But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
User Interface: But but how {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the b
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . How {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Or two buttons .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Uh , two scroll uh wheels .
Marketing: And i if we go to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: If uh {disfmarker} 'Kay c If we do {disfmarker} If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's th that's more difficult .
Marketing: But if we have uh a me Yeah .
Project Manager: It's better in {disfmarker}
Marketing: If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?
Industrial Designer: with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Because uh , from h hundred uh {gap} remote controls , ninety nine have it .
Project Manager: But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .
Marketing: Uh-uh .
Project Manager: Yeah , but {vocalsound} again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You don't know . So , there's no menu .
Industrial Designer: I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No . So you can't use it .
Industrial Designer: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .
Project Manager: Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Good concept . But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: With the scroll button .
Project Manager: That's one .
Industrial Designer: And and this one has to be soft .
Marketing: Uh-uh .
Industrial Designer: And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It's one . Two . Number two .
User Interface: And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Like uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah that's nice .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Here . Trigger . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No . {vocalsound} But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
User Interface: Just to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's not good to use .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but {vocalsound} I'll zap .
User Interface: Oh , like a {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Fuck . Out . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No , it's not good .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . Then uh {disfmarker} Paint it . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Paint it ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: With the scroll thing on , like this ?
Project Manager: One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .
Industrial Designer: So ?
Project Manager: And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Draw it . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Unbelievable .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Not so difficult .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: But if you put {disfmarker} push the the menu button {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .
User Interface: Yeah , wh what {disfmarker} Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
Project Manager: You have to {disfmarker} For the menu .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So {disfmarker} Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um
Industrial Designer: Separate , more separate , h yeah .
Marketing: more separate , yeah .
Project Manager: Yes , okay .
Marketing: Like , you have the menu button in between uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have a big uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Very good . Is it better ? When you uh {gap} the menu , you have to go there there there there .
Industrial Designer: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: They were like round curves , uh different uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay , okay , okay .
Project Manager: First the buttons .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um {disfmarker} The mute button .
Project Manager: Sorry ?
Marketing: We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the {disfmarker} to to uh {disfmarker} have to uh {disfmarker} numbers
Project Manager: Mute . And the other .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Not so difficult .
Marketing: {vocalsound} But , uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
Project Manager: But how do you wanna solve it ?
Industrial Designer: With the switch button .
Project Manager: Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
Industrial Designer: No
Project Manager: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .
Industrial Designer: like uh {disfmarker} Oh , you mean like that .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh , then you can also have like uh th um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: A joystick .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , and joystick , I think .
Project Manager: Yeah . But is it uh {disfmarker} Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .
Industrial Designer: Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi
Project Manager: Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I don't know .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . Why do I pay you for ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um , well {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Better ideas . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And {disfmarker} {gap} No , no . It won't work .
Project Manager: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Uh-huh .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} Think we have to keep them .
Industrial Designer: Or a remote control more like joystick .
Project Manager: Yeah , but is it {disfmarker} That's not expensive than uh {disfmarker} Joystick is better . A small one .
Industrial Designer: A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k
Project Manager: No just like in a
Industrial Designer: Playstation thing .
Project Manager: a laptop . Small , round .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then it's not so big .
Industrial Designer: No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control .
Project Manager: Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} Maybe , if it's possible , {vocalsound} it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: A small one . So , please look at it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No , that's okay , I got {disfmarker}
Marketing: And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they're not uh in details .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah we {disfmarker} I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Then I have to come with it .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .
Project Manager: Your problem . Not mine .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Then I'll uh make something up .
Project Manager: Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it's {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .
User Interface: Mm , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .
Project Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .
Project Manager: So we use a normal battery .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: Yes .
Project Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .
Project Manager: Scroll .
Industrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to
Industrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .
Project Manager: Yes , okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .
Industrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .
Project Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .
Industrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?
Project Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Just use your thumb .
Project Manager: If you use a phone .
Industrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .
Project Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}
