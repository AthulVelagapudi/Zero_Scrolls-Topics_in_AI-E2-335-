Project Manager: We're one big happy family now . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah something like that .
Project Manager: Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first {gap} about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ?
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker} Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Please ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh {disfmarker} {gap}
Project Manager: No uh I did . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah yeah .
Marketing: On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce .
Project Manager: Yep . That's alright .
Marketing: Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player
Project Manager: That would be a nice idea , yes .
Marketing: so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control .
Project Manager: Yep yep yep .
Marketing: Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to {gap} well fifty million ?
Project Manager: Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah yeah
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so a lot of people have to be able to use it .
Industrial Designer: No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: Easy to learn .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah that's right .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh {disfmarker} well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: I also think we should not add too many buttons .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: No that's right .
User Interface: Modern day uh remotes have {vocalsound} too much buttons I think .
Project Manager: Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's {gap}
User Interface: Precisely .
Project Manager: culture uh international .
Marketing: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: Yeah indeed .
Industrial Designer: Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah right .
Project Manager: Yep , and maybe we do uh {vocalsound} we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou
User Interface: Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?
Project Manager: Uh .
Industrial Designer: And stereo uh s uh audio installations .
Project Manager: We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw .
Marketing: Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yep .
User Interface: And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind .
Industrial Designer: Most people do , yeah .
Project Manager: Well yeah .
Industrial Designer: It doesn't {gap}
Project Manager: It doesn't have to be , but we can .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it doesn't have to be {disfmarker}
User Interface: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it .
Project Manager: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ .
Marketing: Yeah but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah because we look at competitors
Industrial Designer: Well .
Project Manager: and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: Yeah but it's {disfmarker} it has to be useable .
Industrial Designer: It has to be different and familiar at the same time .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: {gap} yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing {gap}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you can make it uh triangle shaped ,
User Interface: Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but that's not uh very recognisable .
Marketing: {vocalsound} No .
Project Manager: Oo
Industrial Designer: Oval ?
Project Manager: N we can use uh it as a as a game pad .
User Interface: Yeah or so
Industrial Designer: I {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well yeah it's new . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} . Not with two hands . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah yeah yeah , right .
User Interface: {gap} but young people want something different
Marketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: and it is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well i we already uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .
Project Manager: one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Oh but it ha it has to be m
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to {disfmarker} we can imagine uh
User Interface: Yeah alright .
Project Manager: because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have {vocalsound} been uh tested out so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful
Project Manager: Yes . Well {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: or else uh they would have been ano another shape .
Project Manager: for me personally I have a {vocalsound} a lot of remotes uh at home but {vocalsound} those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle {vocalsound} I don't like to use them . I have uh have to {disfmarker} it has to fit my hands .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: When it falls over it and I just have {disfmarker} and then the button that I use most has to be here .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah
Marketing: It shouldn't be boxy .
Industrial Designer: a lo {gap} the long box shape yeah . You have to {vocalsound} use one hand .
Project Manager: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with {gap} thumb .
Marketing: Nah {disfmarker} I don't agree with the long box uh shape {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Why not ?
Marketing: it it has to be custom made for the hand .
User Interface: Yeah it doesn't fit {gap} .
Project Manager: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape ,
Marketing: Yeah but if you shape it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but then you have {disfmarker}
User Interface: No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ {gap} with their uh remotes {vocalsound} pl players {vocalsound} they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .
Marketing: If {disfmarker}
Project Manager: D_V_D_ players . Yes . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: W no w what else ?
Marketing: No that's ol old fashioned .
Industrial Designer: I di
User Interface: Well {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ?
User Interface: Yes uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: I can imagine that us
User Interface: Well {vocalsound} most of {gap} of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .
Marketing: Yeah right . It fits in your palms .
Industrial Designer: Hmm . Well {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh {vocalsound} round forms in it to fit your hand ,
User Interface: Yeah it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Hmm ?
Project Manager: A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand .
Marketing: Um .
Industrial Designer: but it's it's still {disfmarker} Yeah yeah al alright
Project Manager: That's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but but it's still it's still {gap} sort of box , yeah .
Marketing: {gap} .
User Interface: Yeah yea
Industrial Designer: It it has round forms
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean .
Marketing: Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah I understand , but {disfmarker} no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square
Marketing: It shouldn't be too boxy , you know .
User Interface: Hmm .
Marketing: It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} No no no .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but a also with round edges of course ,
User Interface: {gap} .
Industrial Designer: but in in in at the end it's still this long {vocalsound} box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh {vocalsound} to fit .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right maybe something like this
Industrial Designer: Yeah yes {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} and then a button here to switch between {vocalsound} different systems like D_V_D_ player
Industrial Designer: I thought about something like that . Yeah .
Marketing: and so you can {disfmarker} I've {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: A big recognisable button on top or something .
Marketing: Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: We have five minutes left .
Industrial Designer: The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course ,
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes
Industrial Designer: and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .
Project Manager: uh that's {vocalsound} yep .
Marketing: But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .
Marketing: So there has to be some space between the buttons .
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah right right ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: and maybe we should use colours .
User Interface: Yeah {gap} maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well {gap} {vocalsound} you can you can put on on them ,
Industrial Designer: Colours , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Ha .
User Interface: and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's kinda trendy . Yeah right .
Project Manager: Sound nice . Yes .
User Interface: I dunno but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well it's just uh about our first ideas now
User Interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} .
Project Manager: so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes ?
Industrial Designer: Already thought about something tha {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make ,
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: so we {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well thirty minutes we have . So um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
