User Interface: Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , well . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} According to the drawings .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , you're {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Not me . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So .
Marketing: So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah , mm that's the price we want to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Project Manager: that's the aim for the price for the remote control .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: We aim to do {vocalsound} this profit . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} On the international market .
Marketing: {vocalsound} 'tis big number .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , we're to sell two million then .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Wow .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Mm {vocalsound} for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . {vocalsound} 'Kay {vocalsound} . So any of you have experience in remote controls ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm yeah .
Marketing: Uh yes , we have plenty at home .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} In fact , my daughter likes l {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} remote controls .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm . To eat ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So that could be a great um {vocalsound} application .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
User Interface: Children proof .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Ye ye yeah .
User Interface: Hmm .
Marketing: So she likes uh buttons {vocalsound} which make click ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , pret
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so {vocalsound} it has to click .
Project Manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe ?
Marketing: It has to be uh wha {vocalsound} baby proof {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause they eat {disfmarker} she ate it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: yeah {vocalsound} but mainly it has to be very robust
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: because even if she's not very tall she's uh {vocalsound} high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah .
Marketing: So it has to be very robust .
User Interface: Okay , unbreakable .
Marketing: Unbreakable , yeah .
User Interface: Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: And uh {vocalsound} it has to be nice looking ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: colourful , maybe {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Colourful , yeah mm .
User Interface: Colourful ? That's not practical .
Marketing: colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: No , that's a good idea .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's always black or {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: , they're always black , yeah ,
Project Manager: Mm mm-mm .
User Interface: No .
Marketing: but this one could be I dunno , purple or b
Project Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: But how gonna {disfmarker} okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: No ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: because you think , why not .
User Interface: Otherwise you will never find it .
Marketing: One colour .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh
Marketing: Oh like the phones ,
Industrial Designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah .
Marketing: yeah , it could change colours , yeah .
User Interface: Cool .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: At least for children like one colour and {gap} . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Ch
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Good idea .
Marketing: Good .
Industrial Designer: And it should be really {gap} small and {gap} .
Project Manager: Small also ? Don't you think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Huh not so big like {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager: No uh , not too much buttons or {disfmarker} mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , not too much buttons and {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator
Industrial Designer: Uh . Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} whatever {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: I dunno if it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound} So colour , robustness , easy to use , size ,
Project Manager: So , I think there's {disfmarker}
Marketing: yeah , size matters , yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Colour , {vocalsound} size , sh
Project Manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No , not too small , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like {gap} .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Hmm .
User Interface: Yeah , like a palm sized .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Just to hold it .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh maybe we can change the colours that {disfmarker} at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , at least the colour would be different .
Industrial Designer: you are to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame {gap} .
Marketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're {disfmarker} they never find a good button in the right place .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Marketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow ,
Project Manager: Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um {vocalsound} cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what {disfmarker}
Marketing: I dunno {gap} .
User Interface: No ,
Project Manager: no .
User Interface: no screens , it's too complex .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Too expensive , yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Too expensive for twelve Euro ?
User Interface: And n maybe not too expensive ,
Project Manager: And too expensive .
User Interface: well it's not my problem , but well okay .
Marketing: Ah .
User Interface: But no screens on remote controls .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen {vocalsound} which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right ,
Industrial Designer: Ye yeah .
Marketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control ,
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: if you {disfmarker} if you like .
Industrial Designer: I mean it it's like
Marketing: I don't know if it makes sense , but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} it's like two types no ? {vocalsound} people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this
Marketing: Yeah , for instance , mm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .
Industrial Designer: or {disfmarker} so tha your switch on and off should be on
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: So adaptable {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah something {disfmarker}
User Interface: Adaptable . Alright , good ,
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah .
Project Manager: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound}
User Interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?
Industrial Designer: huh .
User Interface: On off ?
Industrial Designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .
User Interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: Three buttons you mean ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} like three mental states ,
Project Manager: Three option .
User Interface: yeah you know what I mean ,
Marketing: Ah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: we can just make it uh
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Um .
User Interface: controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that ask you three {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .
User Interface: Sh sure , sure .
Marketing: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .
Industrial Designer: Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .
Marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .
Industrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}
Marketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: You do this ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Uh no .
User Interface: I usually just change channels .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .
Project Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .
Industrial Designer: Dash .
Marketing: And then back to the one I was before ,
Project Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}
Marketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .
User Interface: Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: Yeah you can
Project Manager: yeah , that would be cool .
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: Go back button is good .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .
User Interface: I once had it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .
Project Manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound}
User Interface: History . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,
Industrial Designer: Uh .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So I think we have full of idea .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . {vocalsound} So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .
Marketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?
User Interface: Market Expert .
Project Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Marketing {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} {gap} .
Marketing: Uh that's me .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , of course {vocalsound} yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I'll think of that .
Project Manager: Mm okay . So .
Marketing: So ?
Project Manager: I think that's all .
Marketing: Meeting's over ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Great .
Industrial Designer: Thank you .
Marketing: Thank you .
Project Manager: See you in thirty minutes .
User Interface: Thank you everybody .
