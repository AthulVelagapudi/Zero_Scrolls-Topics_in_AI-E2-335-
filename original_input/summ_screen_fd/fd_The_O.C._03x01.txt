You are given a script of a TV episode. Summarize the episode in a paragraph.

Episode Script:
Opening scene - Hospital - the first thing we see is a black screen with the sound of a siren, and what sounds like a dispatch message. I cannot make out the actual words sorry. we see the hospital doors open and paramedics rushing a stretcher inside, there is a bright light so its difficult to see everything - all the talking in this scene is very echoey, and distant. it's very reflective of the situation. there are also a few voiceovers from 224, which I think were done great!)
Paramedic: I got a gun shot wound exited the right clavicle, punctured an artery
(we see a close up of Trey, and the other paramedic is holding a breathing thing over his mouth. a doctor comes down the corridor, putting a gown on)
Dr: he still alive
Paramedic: not for long
V.O Ryan: how could you man...I would'a done anything for you
(we see Trey kind of moving his head a little, then we see the ceiling of the hospital as if we are seeing what Trey is seeing. we then see Ryan & Marissa coming in through the hospital doors, they both look worried and scared)
V.O Trey: look man, it was messed up, I was stoned
(an officer comes into the shot and walks over to Ryan and Marissa as they are coming in)
Officer: we've still got some more questions for you
(Ryan walks passed the officer and over towards Trey)
Ryan: I've jus gotta see if he's gonna be ok
(we see Trey, still with the breathing thing over his mouth, being pushed away. there is another voice over here but its at the same time as the next line so I cant tell what it is, its possibly a scream/cry from Marissa)
Marissa: (worried, to a nurse) he's not gonna die, right
(behind Marissa we see Seth and Summer enter, they both look worried as well, and they are looking in the direction of Marissa/Ryan/Trey. behind them we can see the ambulance Trey came out of)
V.O Ryan: it wasn't my idea Trey, I didn't wanna steal that car
(we see another shot of Trey, which is a close up of his bloody face, and a little of his chest. here we see a bit of the hospital roof and light, but also blended into it is the scene where Trey pulled the gun on Ryan at his apartment in 224. its been done similar to how we saw the Ryan/Marissa 'who are you' scene during the Ryan/Lindsay car conversation of 208 . its a blink and you'll miss it deal :))
V.O Trey: hey man I went away for it an uh you got the good life
V.O Ryan: so you had to destroy it, you had to hurt her, huh
(the last thing we see is Trey pointing the gun at Ryan, then we see the hospital light again and Trey being rushed down the corridor. Ryan comes around the corner, behind Trey, the doctor and the paramedics)
Ryan: hey, he's my brother, is he gonna be ok
Dr: he'd be better if someone hadn't shot him
(the Dr and paramedics move the stretcher closer to the bed, nurses are also there)
Dr: he's lost alot of blood so (turns around and sees Ryan) Jesus what the hell happened'a you
Ryan: (looks at Dr) nothing I'm fine
Dr: (yells) could someone look at this kid
(Ryan turns away from the Dr and everything goes blurry)
Officer: just as soon as we're done talking to him
(we see a close up of Ryan, and he has a noticeable bruise, and bloody nose, he also looks out of it. he looks away from the officer and back at Trey. we see Trey being moved over to the bed, then someone squeezing the breathing thing over his mouth. we then see Marissa and Summer standing together near the hospital doors, an officer is with them)
Marissa: (yells) Ryan
(Ryan turns to face Marissa, she puts her hand out to Ryan helplessly)
Officer: (holding the gun) did you discharge this weapon man
Marissa: (looks at officer, frustrated) yes I already t-
Ryan: (yells urgently) don't answer him, don't say anything
(the officer near Ryan looks over towards Marissa, shocked. Marissa looks at Ryan and shrugs. the background goes out of focus, Seth comes into the shot clearly on the right hand side)
Seth: you ok (Ryan looks at him)
Dr: we're losing him
(Ryan turns towards where they are working on Trey. we see a very quick flashback of Trey and Ryan, then we see them still working on Trey, squeezing the breathing thing. Ryan looks away from Trey and back towards Seth, dazed. we see how Ryan is seeing, which is Seth as wavy, then squashed/ stretched)
Seth: you alright
(Ryan looks at Seth, blinking and breathing heavily. his vision is now bordering on blurry. we can see Marissa out of focus in the background still. Sandy comes through the hospital doors)
Sandy: Ryan (Ryan looks at him, still blinking and dazed) Seth...you ok
(Ryan is now seeing Sandy as short/fat, and wavy. we see Ryan looking at Sandy & Seth, growing more and more disoriented till he falls and passes out on the floor. we see what he is seeing as he falls, then we hear the thud and see Ryan on his stomach next to Treys bed. - we then abruptly cut to the pool house where Ryan has jolted himself awake. he blinks and slightly lifts his head, we can see a bit of sun on his cheek. he looks freaked out. he then lifts his head more and opens his eyes wider. he rubs his hand down his face, and sniffs. we then see Ryan sitting up on his elbow in bed, we can also see a silhouette at his door, and then we hear a knock. Seth opens the door and walks in, in true Seth style, lol)
Seth: hey man, I jus wanted you ta know that uh (stops and looks at Ryan worried) you ok
Ryan: (looks at Seth, then looks away and sighs) I just had the worst nightmare (raises eyebrows)
Seth: yeah, I got some...bad news
Ryan: it wasn't a dream (closes eyes) yeah, yeah I know (opens eyes)
Seth: well that lawyer guys on his way over so...
Ryan: (softly) thankyou
(Seth turns and leaves. we see a close up of Ryan who looks worried)
Cooper-Nichol veranda - we see an aerial shot of the pool, and Marissa and Summer sun-baking beside it. think 201. it then changes to a front on shot of them, but it's as if it's on top of the pool water, half way through Summers line it changes to a close up of them. Marissa has her head back, with sunglasses on
Summer: you know Coop, if you had of asked what we'd be doing the weekend before senior year (thinks) I probably would've said a road trip to Rosarito or rush week at SU with college boys
Marissa: an waiting to get charged with manslaughter
Summer: (shakes head) wouldnt'a made the list (looks at Marissa) mm-mm...(reassuringly) your gonna get through this Coop (looks at Marissa with one eye open, one closed from the sun) your innocent you were saving Ryan's life
Marissa: (lifts head) try explaining that to Ryan
Summer: he understands why you did it he's not mad (shakes head)
Marissa: its jus like this... weird horrible thing (lays head back) hanging over us...like the elephant in the room...or an intensive care unit
Summer: (frowns) before Trey I never actually knew anyone in a coma (shakes head) well I mean on the valley there's someone in a coma (Marissa frowns) like every week but I think they only do that so that when the person wakes up another actor can play the part (nods, confidently)
Marissa: (raises eyebrows) unfortunately if Trey wakes up he's still gonna be Trey...if he wakes up (looks down)
Summer: you've got'to admit Coop (Marissa looks at her) whatever happens, Ryan facing off with Trey to avenge your honour, god that is SO-FREAKING-HOT (Marissa doesn't say anything) ...in a mythic, biblical, Samurai Western kind of way
Marissa: I really wish that helped me sleep at night Summer (puts head back)
Summer: (frowns, concerned) you're still not sleeping
Marissa: I shot someone Sum (Summer looks at her, then away) an even if he lives, which...is a big if, I'm still gonna have'to live with that for the rest of my life
Summer: (nods) oh (puts head back & closes eyes) senior year
Marissa: (scoffs) should be all time (half smiles)
(we see the backs of the pool chairs and a shot of the house)
CUT TO: Cohen kitchen - Sandy pours a whole pot of coffee into a tall mug
DDA: thaaanks a bunch, Sandy
Sandy: if a pot'n a half isn't enough to get you through the morning (holds out mug) I can make some more
DDA: that'd be great (drinks)
(Sandy looks at the DA and then picks up the pot to refill it)
Sandy: sorry for the mess, its ben a little hectic (looks over) Seth'll be right down
DDA: (frowns) and Mr. Atwood
Sandy: he's gettin' dressed, well the kids've ben through alot this summer with all this hangin over them, and now school is starting
DDA: which is why the DA wants to get moving, we waited as long as we could for the other Mr. Atwood to wake up but I'm getting alotta calls from parents...DA's under alotta pressure ta prosecute (drinks)
Sandy: except there's nothin ta prosecute, Marissa's protected under the defense of others (looks at DDA) of course your boss may not find that very sexy
DDA: quite true...(looks at Sandy) DA's not lookin to go after Marissa
Sandy: (looks at DDA, annoyed) Ryan's innocent...you got his statement at the scene an hers
DDA: look at the record Ryan's got, his history of violence...an Caleb Nichols daughters the one blowin away ex cons with a forty five
Sandy: (looks at DDA) she saved Ryan's life
DDA: what was he doin over at Treys in the first place, his brother tried to rape his girlfriend (Sandy pours more coffee) we've got cause
Sandy: yeah, an ya got witnesses
DDA: well the only people who saw the gun go off were Mr. Atwood Miss Cooper an the other Mr. Atwood, who (raises eyebrows) may or may not wake up
Sandy: (turns to face DDA) if you go after Ryan even if he's brought in on charges...social services could take him away from us
DDA: which explains Miss Coopers motivation to cover for him (nods confidently) Mr. Atwood's got alot more to lose
(Sandy glares at the DDA then turns back to the coffee)
DDA: where is your wife anyway
Sandy: (sighs) she's outta town
CUT TO: Suriak Treatment Centre garden - we see a close up of Kirsten, as the scene goes on we see that she is in a group therapy session and Dr Woodruff is there leading it
Kirsten: my name is Kirsten an I'm an alcoholic
Group: hi Kirsten
(we can now see they are all seated on chairs around the fountain)
Dr W: Kirsten your progress here at Suriak has ben...truly wonderful to watch (nods) your a model patient for...everyone here
(everyone looks towards Kirsten, however one patient near Kirsten looks more interested than the rest. a woman who is one person away from Kirsten, we find out later her name is Charlotte)
Kirsten: (shy) well I don't know about that...I mean Shelley is definitely better at poker (Shelley looks worried) she's cleaned me out
(everyone laughs)
Kirsten: (smiles, looks down) but...being here has given me the clarity to understand...why I turned to alcohol in the first place
Dr W: an...do you feel comfortable sharing with the group uh why that was
Kirsten: uh sure...I mean we're all in this together...I uh (thinks) I guess it begins and ends with my dad (nods, frowns) he was (shakes head, closes eyes) an amazing man (shrugs) but controlling...and...I realised that I was living his life not mine (Dr W listens) after my mother died I did everything (Charlotte is listening intently) I could to please him (sighs) but I realised that no matter how hard I worked or how hard I tried-
Charlotte: it was never enough (Kirsten looks at her) ...I'm sorry
Kirsten: (suprised) uh, no (looks at Charlotte) no its true it was never enough, became my mantra (smiles) ...I was never a good enough wife or a mom (raises eyebrows) because I wasn't a good enough daughter
Dr W: (points at Kirsten) the power that comes with that kind of difficult realisation, will be invaluable after you leave us
Kirsten: are you trying'to get rid'a me (smiles)
(everyone laughs)
Dr W: well, it sounds to me like uh Suriak's work is done (Kirsten smiles, then looks unsure) you'll need ta get a sponsor...an attend meetings...but there's no reason you can't do that from your home
(Charlotte looks at Kirsten, as if she knows Kirsten isn't ready yet)
Kirsten: great (forces a smile)
CUT TO: Cohen dining room - Ryan is sitting on one side of the table with his hands clasped together in front of him, and the DDA is sitting opposite him. Sandy is standing at the end of the table, close by. this scene changes between Ryan and Seth, kind of a blend of their 2 depositions so you'll know who's it was depending on who is talking, Ryan or Seth
DDA: Mr. Atwood (Ryan looks away) do you swear to tell the truth an nothing but the truth so help you god-
Ryan: (fed up) I do (sighs)
DDA: well then you won't mind if I record this deposition (slides recorder across the table)
Seth: sure, record it, release it on ITunes, I hope it's a really big hit
Sandy: (not amused) just answer the questions
Ryan: (looks at Sandy) I've already answered all of these questions (looks at DDA) I have nothing new'to say (looks down)
DDA: well your previous statement came at the hospital...it was traumatic its ben a couple'a months maybe you remember things differently now
Seth: I remember everything exactly as I told you
DDA: well then you can tell me again
Ryan: ...I (leans forward) confronted Trey about what had happened and that's when he pulled the gun on me
Seth: then we called Marissa to see if maybe she could stop Ryan
Ryan: an that's when Marissa saved my life
DDA: you mean, that's when Marissa shot Trey (Seth nods) an you witnessed the shooting
Seth: well it was clear w- when we got there what had happened
DDA: just answer the question
Ryan: (yells, fed up) no I did not (calmer) I didn't- (raises eyebrows) an-an an I didn't shoot him (Sandy looks at DDA)
DDA: young fingerprints are on the gun
Ryan: yeah because I put the safety back on to make sure it didn't go off again
(we see a close up of the recorder)
Ryan: we-we (agitated, sighs) ...we weren't exactly thinking at the time
DDA: so one final question, what were you afraid (frowns) was going to happen between Ryan an his brother...why were you trying to stop him
(Seth doesn't say anything, Sandy looks down)
DDA: you went to Treys that night to kill your brother (Ryan looks at him) didn't you Mr. Atwood
(Ryan swallows and doesn't say anything. we see a close up of the recorder just as it stops recording)
CUT TO: Cooper-Nichol veranda - Jimmy is setting the table and Julie is in front of him looking at herself in the reflection of a window
Jimmy: (puts plate down) so what kind'a food d'you think prosecutors like
Julie: (fixes hair) cause that's what's important here Jimmy (sighs, turns around) ok so (holds out hands) does this look like the outfit the mother of an innocent girl would wear
Jimmy: yeah well at least somebody has their priorities in order...
Julie: (sighs) I just hope Marissa listens to me, and our attorney, the last thing we need is her admitting ta the DA that she shot someone
Jimmy: Jules (looks at Julie, confused) she already admitted it
Julie: she wasn't in a right frame of mind when she spoke to the police...its not like she's a trained assassin
Jimmy: uh-huh so-so (frowns) what's our story, Trey shot himself...in the back
Julie: no, Jimmy, be reasonable
Jimmy: she's not gonna lie an say Ryan did it, they already have her statement
Julie: nobody believes her, they all think she's protecting him
Jimmy: (looks at Julie) so you want Ryan to go away for this
Julie: ...all I know is that before he moved to Newport our lives were alot more normal, stable
Jimmy: (nods) uh-huh so it's his fault that I went bankrupt an nearly went to jail, an you married Caleb Nichol (raises eyebrows) only to watch him drown in a pool annnn Trey got shot (moves closer to Julie)
Julie: (not amused) Jimmy, not everything I say is meant literally, I'm venting (faces Jimmy) look I wish none'a this ever happened but it did, an we have a chance to be a family again...I don't wanna lose that (Jimmy puts his hand on her shoulder) l w- put out some crudités' an the guda ill go see if Marissa's out of the shower
(Julie goes inside and Jimmy turns around, looking worried)
CUT TO: Pool House - Ryan comes out of the bathroom with a towel over his shoulder and Seth comes to the open doors from outside
Seth: (calls out) hey, you decent (Ryan shuts the bathroom door) thought maybe you could...use a post-depo-dip
Ryan: (holds up the towel) I just showered
Seth: mmm a fair point, then we'll stay away from aquatic activity something land locked maybe
Ryan: (thinks) I'm gonna visit Trey
Seth: I was gonna go with a movie, this bein the time when Hollywood dumps their crappy would be blockbusters which we could mock (touches his chest) an thus feel better about ourselves
Ryan: (ignoring Seth, stands) you got the keys (raises eyebrows)
Seth: but (puts up finger) visiting your comatose brother in the I.C.U that's...also an excellent way ta relax an blow off steam so ill drive
Ryan: awesome
(Seth turns around and goes out the doors. Ryan is behind him)
CUT TO: Cooper-Nichol veranda - Jimmy, Julie, the DDA from earlier and Mr. Esbenshade are standing together near the table
Julie: (holding jug) Mr. Caldwell, would you like some more lemonade (smiles) Mr. Esbenshade
(Mr. Esbenshade shakes his head and mouths 'no thanks' at Julie)
Julie: oh come on its ok for a prosecutor an defense attorney to have a glass of lemonade together (Mr. Esbenshade smiles) we're all human beings here
Jimmy: (frowns) I'm not so sure about these guys
(Julie turns around and looks at Jimmy. Marissa and Summer come out the door)
DDA: Miss Cooper
(Marissa and Summer reluctantly walk over, they both look unsure)
DDA: I'm Deputy District Attorney Chris Caldwell ill be conducting this deposition
Marissa: hi (looks down) uh where do you want us ta sit
DDA: actually (looks at Summer) Miss Roberts cant be present (Marissa frowns) we wouldn't want you influencing her testimony
Marissa: (confused) she (points) knows what you know which is the truth, which is what I already told you people
DDA: Miss Roberts (raises eyebrows) if you could please wait inside
(Summer doesn't know what to do. Marissa and Summer look at each other)
Julie: Summer, we have HBO on demand, every season of s*x and The City, knock yourself out
(Summer looks at Julie. Marissa looks down, sadly. the mean DDA guy from earlier takes out the recorder and puts it on the table)
Summer: Mariss you'll be ok, I'm jus gonna wait inside
Marissa: (to Julie & Jimmy) look I already told everybody everything, I don't wanna have'to go through this again (Jimmy looks down) talk about all of it in front of these strangers (points)
Esbenshade: Marissa I need to remind you this deposition is binding, your testimony in court can't waver from what is said here
Marissa: (frustrated) I already told the truth so what's the problem
DDA: the problem, Miss Cooper, is that your testimony lacks credibility
(Summer Marissa and Esbenshade look at him, Marissa looks down. Julie looks at Jimmy)
DDA: Miss Roberts please wait inside
(DDA, Marissa & Mr. Esbenshade go to sit at the table)
Jimmy: come on Summer
(Jimmy puts his hand on Summers back and leads her inside)
DDA: now Miss Cooper, I'm going to have'to swear you in
(Marissa turns to look at Summer, we see a close up of her face and she looks vulnerable. Summer looks at Marissa helplessly before going inside - i just have to say that you can really see how much Marissa/Summer need each other in this scene)
Julie: it'll be ok Marissa
(Marissa glances at Julie before looking down, upset)
CUT TO: The I.C.U - as the camera pans across we see through the blinds that Ryan is sitting next to Treys bed, we can also hear some hospital announcements faintly. the shot changes and we can now see that Seth is also in the room, leaning against the door frame. Trey is still in a coma and Ryan is leaning forward staring at him
Seth: I kinda like him this way he's a better listener (Ryan blinks and looks down) ...sorry, I get talkative around coma patients it's a (frowns) compensation thing, ill give you guys a minute
Ryan: wait just uh
(Ryan turns to Seth then back to Trey, he stands and leaves the room. the camera zooms in on Treys hand and after a few seconds his pinky finger very noticeably moves - out in the corridor Ryan and Seth are walking together)
Ryan: sorry man (raises eyebrows) I don't even know why I came here (Seth listens) that night I wanted to kill him now id do anything to take it back
Seth: well you can't blame yourself an you can't change what happened
Ryan: yeah but I mean Trey could'a tried to make it work, living in town I mean I had my brother here
(Ryan and Seth are now outside near the ambulance bay)
Ryan: now everything's screwed up an he's the only family I got left
Seth: (looks at Ryan) well that's not exactly true
(Ryan realises and half smiles then looks down. back in Treys room we see the monitor that he's hooked up to, that goes out of focus and Treys head comes into focus, his eyes suddenly open and look around)
CUT TO: Cohen living room - on the TV we see a video game of baseball being played. half way through Seth's lines we see that Ryan and Seth are sitting on the couch together
Seth: ok I jus have'to say that I still support the recent decision (Ryan looks at him) (swallows) in the wake of all the violence we've experienced to ban any games with ninjas or guns (frowns)
Ryan: yeah, but?
Seth: weeell it's just I don't understand any of the rules to this..."baseball" they call it
Ryan: (looks at Seth) you mean America's pastime
Seth: (looks at Ryan, unsure) eah, feels like more of a fad to me buddy I don't really see it catchin on
Ryan: (nods) sure (frowns) hey you called Marissa an Summer right
(phone rings. Seth gets up to answer it)
Seth: they're with the dark lords son or whatever the DA's name is, did that guy blink once during your deposition...he didn't even have eyelids (answers phone) hello...oh I'm sorry he's not in right now can I take a message...ok thankyou (hangs up)
(Seth looks over at Ryan, Ryan looks at Seth)
Seth: that was the hospital Trey woke up
(Ryan looks at Seth, stunned)
CUT TO: Suriak T.C - Kirsten is sitting out the front by herself. Charlotte goes over to her
Charlotte: Kirsten, right (holds hand out) hi I'm Charlotte Morgan, I'm so sorry about interrupting you in group
Kirsten: (shakes hand) oooh no no that's ok (smiles)
Charlotte: (sits next to Kirsten) when I heard you talking it was like you were describing my life...the rich dominating father the high pressure...nothing was (raises eyebrows) ever good enough
Kirsten: eah I'm jus glad I didn't bore you (laughs)
Charlotte: no it was amazing, I mean to hear someone on the same journey as me...well, obviously your a little further along (smiles) I couldnt've ever admitted all that (Kirsten raises her eyebrows then looks down) your so brave an honest
Kirsten: I don't know about that but thankyou (smiles, nods)
Charlotte: d'you wanna maybe get coffee sometime, we can...talk trash about our dads
Kirsten: (suprised) sure id love to (smiles)
(we hear the sound of a car horn)
Charlotte: ok (smiles)
(we see Sandy pull up in a gorgeous black Lexus)
Kirsten: ahh, that's my husband
(Sandy has a huge smile on his face, Kirsten looks just as excited as he does! aww)
Charlotte: oh well, I don't wanna take up anymore of your time (smiles) goodbye
Kirsten: bye
(Charlotte walks off as Sandy gets out of the car. Kirsten goes over to him. Sandy has a HUGE smile on his face, and giggles)
Kirsten: (touches Sandy shoulders) look at you
(Sandy puts his hands on Kirsten's back, gently holding her. they look at each other then kiss! we see Charlotte watching them with a weird look on her face. we then see Kirsten and Sandy again, they are now in an adorable hug. Sandy has his head buried in Kirsten's neck then they pull apart. Charlotte is still watching, after a few seconds she leaves. the next thing we see is Sandy and Kirsten walking together near the fountain. Sandy is holding Kirsten's hand in his, and has his other hand on top. Kirsten puts her head on his shoulder. awww)
Kirsten: (trying not to laugh) so it exploded all over the kitchen
Sandy: ahh the microwave mostly
Kirsten: an entire jar of peanut butter
Sandy: oh we were tryin'a make peanut butter cookies as a suprise for you (Kirsten smiles) (frowns) it seemed like such a good idea at the time
Kirsten: well it's a well known science factoid that metal plus heat equals...
Sandy: peanut butter everywhere (Kirsten smiles) these are just a few'a the lessons we three struggling handsome bachelors are learnin every week (laughs)
Kirsten: oh, sounds like you have a reality series here (smiles adoringly)
Sandy: no, I hope it's not a reality for too long (looks at Kirsten adoringly)
(Kirsten doesn't say anything)
Sandy: (looks down) so...you should be comin home any day now right (Kirsten looks at Sandy) just give me a heads up so I can make sure the house is liveable (nods)
Kirsten: (thrown) yeah I-I just have'to sit down with (shrugs) Dr Woodruff soon an-an see what's going on (nods) see if I'm eligible (raises eyebrows)
(Sandy looks at Kirsten. his cell phone rings)
Sandy: (looks at phone) oh (answers) hey Seth, I'm here with mom (Kirsten smiles) huh...well thanks for calling...ill see you when I get back at the house (hangs up)
Kirsten: is everything ok
Sandy: yeah, he says hi, that he misses you
Kirsten: mm-hmm
Sandy: I better get going (Kirsten nods) get back ta work
(Sandy kisses Kirsten hard on the mouth, and holds her face in his hands. aww. they smile at each other)
Sandy: jus let me know what the doctor says
Kirsten: (nods, softly) ok
Sandy: alright
(Sandy takes Kirsten's hands in his and then let's go as he starts to leave. Kirsten watches him go. she sighs heavily and looks worried)
CUT TO: The Beach - we see Marissa sitting by herself staring out towards the water. we then see a car pull up. Marissa looks over and we see Ryan get out. Marissa stands, and Ryan walks over to her
Marissa: hey, so what's going on
Ryan: ...Treys awake

Ryan: yeah, our futures in Treys hands (Marissa doesn't say anything) come on (motions) Seth an Summer are at the diner
(Ryan walks back over to the car and Marissa follows him. they both get in)
CUT TO: Newport Group - Julie, Jimmy, and alot of other people sorting through things are in there, including Jeff Frankel
Julie: (impatient) what'do you mean it's gonna take two months, Caleb wrote a will just read it already
Jeff: (puts hand up) it's much more difficult than that Mrs. Cooper-Nichol a-as you can see (Jimmy looks around) there's uh alotta paperwork uh a number of different offshore accounts we haven't yet found
Julie: ok, well you just take your sweet time Mr. Frankel but understand this, we are paying a very high price defense attorney to protect our daughter an right now the metres running

Jimmy: (to Julie) Julie, the hospital called
Julie: (looks at Jimmy) what, what'did they say
CUT TO: The Diner - we see a plate of food being set down in front of someone. the camera pans and we see that Summer, Seth, Marissa and Ryan are near by in a booth. Ryan looks at Marissa, Marissa looks at him and then at Seth and Summer, almost sadly. Summer and Seth are watching both of them across the table
Summer: ok (claps hands) I have an idea
Seth: (looks at Summer) are you gonna save Chrismukkah again cause I really enjoyed that last time
(Summer glares at Seth, not amused. Seth closes his mouth tightly)
Summer: we need to have some fun (raises eyebrows)
Marissa: (looks at Summer unenthusiastically) fun (raises eyebrows)
(Ryan looks at Summer)
Summer: yeah, look we cant control the future right so how do we deal (Seth frowns) I mean we could do what my step-mother does an take lots of pain killers to numb ourselves from the reality that life is (frowns) well random, unfair an ultimately meaningless
Seth: (looks at Summer) there's another option right
Summer: or we can accept the fact that we cant worry about what we cant control an just enjoy the time that we have, Treys awake an...school is starting soon (Marissa looks at Ryan) who knows what's ta come, right...so this might be our last chance to have fun
Seth: I like...plan B
(Marissa smiles)
Ryan: so what'do we do
Marissa: ...well I have an idea (raises eyebrows) but id have'to ask my dad first
(Summer and Seth look at Marissa, curious)
CUT TO: The Ocean - we see a beautiful shot of the water and in the distance is a sail boat, as the camera zooms in closer and changes angles we can see Marissa and Ryan are sitting near the front talking/laughing. the shot goes across the front of Ryan and Marissa and then we can see that Seth and Summer are sitting together near the steering wheel. the shot changes again and we see the boat from above. then we see Ryan and Marissa again, still sitting together laughing/talking. they look so cute! we see Seth and Summer again, and we can also see a row boat sitting on the back. we can now see that its Jimmy's sail boat 'Slow Dance'
[SCENE_BREAK]
CUT TO: A Secluded Beach - we see the sail boat in the distance out in the water. the row boat is sitting on the sand and further off to the left is Seth and Summer
Summer: Mr. Coopers got a nice boat huh
Seth: yeah (picks up sticks) its amazing what laundered money can buy
Summer: you know Cohen, with your two hands on the wheel an the wind blowing through your hair (looks at Seth, nods) you actually looked kinda hot
Seth: let me guess Summer you have a (shrugs, amused) weakness for seamen (smiles)
Summer: (screws up her face) ewww Cohen, an then there's that (walks away)
Seth: nah, aww (follows Summer)
(Marissa is sitting on some rocks by herself, looking out towards the ocean. Ryan goes over to her)
Ryan: hey

(Ryan sits down next to Marissa)
Ryan: ah...how ya doin, you ok
Marissa: (looks at Ryan) yeah I guess...I mean I-I don't know to be honest (unsure) are we ok
Ryan: yeah sure (shrugs) why wouldn't we be
Marissa: cause since that night we haven't really talked about it
(Ryan doesn't say anything. Seth and Summer walk over to them)
Seth: hey, knock it off, listen, we gotta get our mind off everything...who wants to go fishing
Summer: (laughs) yeah you guys do the hunting, we'll do the gathering
Ryan: (stands) I like that idea but weeee-dont-have-any-bait
Seth: ooh...hey wait no we have Summer (touches Summers arm) this little sardine
Summer: nooo, you guys that's-
(Marissa smiles, Ryan points at Summer mischieviously)
Seth: I'm gonna throw a sardine, who wants to go fishing, come on
(Summer squeals and runs down the beach. Seth goes after her, Ryan runs after them)
Summer: no guys
(the next bit is a montage with laughing & screaming. we see Ryan with Summer in his arms, and Seth and Marissa are either side of Ryan. then we see Summer kicking her legs, Seth holding onto them and Marissa touching Ryan's back, and they are near the water. the next thing we see is Marissa over Ryan's shoulder, and they are in the water ankle deep. Summer and Seth are standing near them. then we see them moving away from the tide. Seth has Summer over his shoulder and Ryan goes to pick Marissa up. then we see Ryan holding Marissa in his arms, Seth holding Summer over his shoulder and they are at the edge of the water. SO CUTE! next we see Ryan holding Seth long ways. he has one hand over both his legs and the other under his waist. Summer claps and they are laughing and having a good time! the next thing we see is a lifeguard tower. Marissa is leaning up against it and Ryan is standing in front of her, smiling. he slowly leans toward her and they kiss! awww Marissa has her hands on Ryan's shoulders. the shot changes and we see them still kissing, and the back of Ryan. we then see them all playing near the water again, it looks as though the sun is starting to go down. Ryan has both hands in the air like a monster and he goes after the girls. they both squeal and run away. the next thing we see is Seth holding a football, he throws it and Ryan goes to catch it but drops it in the water. then we see Summer and Seth sitting together by a fire in the sand. the sun is almost gone. they look so cute! we then see that they are roasting marshmallows on sticks together! Seth kisses Summer on the cheek and Summer smiles all cutesy. we then see Ryan and Marissa close up, kissing at the lifeguard tower like before. their heads slowly disappear out the bottom of the shot and all we see is the water. the next thing we see is the sun setting, with the lifeguard tower in the background. then we see the two couples sitting together near the fire. Marissa and Summer both have blankets over their shoulders)
Marissa: well, if this is as good as it gets for a while
Ryan: (smiles) eah, feels pretty good
Summer: yeah (sarcastic) thanks for almost getting my bathing suit wet Cohen
Seth: my pleasure
Ryan: (mocking Summer, very nasally tone) Cohen, I can't believe that you did that Cohen (smirks)
(Marissa and Summer laugh. we see a shot of the backs of them. Ryan puts his arm around Marissa and their heads are touching. Summer rests her head on Seth's shoulder. awww, could they get more adorable!)
CUT TO: The I.C.U - through the blinds we can see Trey in bed. the camera moves across to show a nurse in the nursing station. the nurse hears a noise and looks up. all we see is a dark corridor. the nurse looks down. we then see bright pink high heels walking towards the camera. we then see the shadow of a head in the bottom right hand corner, and the nurse still with her head down
Julie: I'm looking for Trey Atwood
Nurse: (stands) I'm sorry, visiting hours ended a while ago
Julie: oh did I forget to introduce myself, I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol as in the Nichol wing of this hospital which we're both standing in
Nurse: ...oh hello Mrs. Cooper-Nichol
Julie: (smiles) my husband was very philanthropic, hospitals were his favourite charity, especially making sure nurses an orderlies were compensated for their hard work (looks at Nurse) I would hate ta see his passion fall by the wayside
(the Nurse looks at Julie, Julie looks at the nurse. the next thing we see is Treys room. Trey opens his eyes and reels back, we then see what he is reacting to. Julie is standing beside his bed)
Julie: hello Trey (smiles) I've ben wanting to talk to you (Trey looks at her) oh no no, no pleasantries...look at you...lying there all helpless (closes the blinds) unable to stop me from (picks up a pillow) doing whatever I wanted to (Trey looks at her) kind of like the night you tried to rape my daughter
Trey: ...I'm sorry
Julie: (clenches teeth) oh you should be you son of a bitch...which is why your gonna help me (Trey looks at her) in exchange I'm prepared to compensate you, how does twenty thousand dollars sound
Trey: (laughs) what d- what...do you want
Julie: three simple words, repeat after me Trey...Ryan-shot-me (Trey looks at her, reluctant) Trey (raises the pillow)
Trey: (swallows) ...Ryan...shot...
CUT TO: Cohen living room - the first thing we see is the TV, on the screen is the movie Teen Wolf. Seth is sitting on the couch in his PJ's with his feet on the coffee table. Ryan sits down next to him with a breakfast bowl
Seth: ok so, I know Teen Wolf is not a realistic movie (puts hand on his mouth, thinking)
Ryan: really goin out on a limb there but yeah (puts feet on the coffee table)
Seth: well (frowns) I mean how does bein a werewolf make you a better basketball player
Ryan: can't argue with that one
(Sandy comes in)
Sandy: hey fellas (Ryan & Seth look at him) you mind shuttin off the TV (points)
(Seth turns the TV off and Ryan puts his bowl down)
Sandy: Trey talked to the police this morning...an he confirmed their suspicion that it was you who shot him (Ryan looks at him, stunned)
Seth: well that's a total lie
(Ryan looks away)
Sandy: now the DA's office gave me a heads up...there gonna be issuing a warrant for your arrest in a few hours, now we're gonna figure this thing out (Ryan looks down) but I need to know that you are telling me everything that happened
(Ryan looks up at Sandy, Sandy looks at him)
Ryan: (stands, tied of it all) what difference does it make
(Ryan leaves the room upset. Sandy watches him)
Seth: your gonna fix this right (looks at Sandy, hopeful)
(Sandy watches Ryan go into the pool house and slam the door behind him)
CUT TO: Cooper-Nichol veranda - Julie is carrying a bucket with champagne in it, Jimmy is with her
Jimmy: a little early for champagne don't you think
Julie: I'm making mimosa's, there breakfast appropriate besides we should celebrate
Jimmy: (frowns) celebrate the fact that Marissa's boyfriend is...getting arrested
Julie: no the fact that Marissa isn't (smiles & pours)
Jimmy: you know Julie its just a little too convenient, Trey wakes up an immediately points the finger at Ryan
Julie: well, sometimes, Jimmy, and I know you don't have that much experience with this but...things work out
Jimmy: you know...even if Marissa was accused sh-she wouldn't go to jail
Julie: she also wouldn't be going to college, forget what the law says about just cause an defense of others, how's it gonna look on her college application under extra curriculars, shoots blue collar thugs
Jimmy: look I don't want Marissa to suffer either but Ryan-
Julie: Ryan's (puts finger up) dye was cast long before he moved inta the Cohen pool house look (closes eyes) Jimmy lets just puts this to bed (Marissa comes out) we'll collect on Caleb's will an we'll go back to being a normal, happy, family!

Jimmy: ...but just...not so good forrr Ryan
(Marissa looks worried)
CUT TO: Cohen house - we see a shot of the pool house. all the blinds are shut and you can't see in. we then see that Seth and Summer are standing inside at the glass doors looking out
Seth: well we know he wants to be left alone

(sound of the door bell. Summer and Seth both look in the direction of the door. the next thing we see is Seth walking towards the door, Summer is following behind him, with her hands holding onto the waist of his jeans, aww. Seth opens the door and Marissa is standing there)
Marissa: where is he (anxious)
Seth: ahh he's not really seeing visitors right now (shuts the door)

(Marissa sighs and looks at them both like 'please' then heads out to the pool house)
Seth: this should go well

(Kirsten walks away and Charlotte watches her)
CUT TO: The Pool House - Sandy knocks on the door, when there's no answer he opens the door and goes in
Sandy: hello...I'm back
(Sandy stares at the empty pool house then turns around and faces the door, he looks around worried. we hear the sound of the door bell. we then see the front door, through the glass we can see a man. Sandy opens the door and we see that it is an officer with the warrant for Ryan's arrest in his hand. another office is behind him talking on a walkie talkie, and we can see their police car)
Officer: we're lookin for Ryan Atwood (holds out the warrant)
Sandy: your a little late I'm afraid
CUT TO: Marissa's bedroom - Julie walks in and looks around, she then puts the phone up to her ear
Julie: nope, she's not here either an she left for your house hours ago Sandy, you don't think they'd try anything do you (worried)
(Jimmy comes to the doorway)

(Marissa turns on a light)
Seth: are you kidding, this is a great excuse to skip school
Marissa: uh its not forever it's just until we can get Trey to change his story
(we hear the sound of sirens, and see about a half dozen police cars pull up and surround them. one of the cars shines a light on the boat and we see them looking at all the police cars. Marissa and Summer are both shielding their eyes from the bright light. we see a close up of Ryan's face, just staring into the light)
CUT TO: The Police Station - we see Ryan being led by an officer. he is wearing that familiar blue jumpsuit :(. Sandy is waiting for him in a room, and the officer leads him in. Ryan looks at Sandy. Sandy stands up
Sandy: glad to see the jumpsuit still fits
(Sandy motions for Ryan to sit down)
Sandy: well kid, for someone who's innocent you done a hell of a job to look guilty
Ryan: glad to see you're here to make me feel better (smiles sarcastically, then looks down)
Sandy: no I'm here to tell you the truth...as your lawyer an your guardian (Ryan looks at him) the only person who runs is somebody whose got somethin'a hide

Sandy: this isn't over...the arraignments set for tomorrow, we're gonna fight this (Ryan half laughs then looks down) Trey could still change his mind
Ryan: yeah...how's that gonna happen
(Ryan looks at Sandy vulnerably, he almost looks like he's going to cry! :( )
CUT TO: The Hospital - the camera pans up to show Marissa and Summer in the good old candy striper outfits. Seth is in between them pushing a cart down the corridor
Marissa: I haven't worn this candy stripers outfit since, like the tenth grade (folds her arms)
Summer: well maybe we should start volunteering again, it's good for charity
Seth: not that I'm against you guys wearing these uniforms, cause I'm not but...doesn't this plan seem a little light hearted given the...nature of the predicament
Summer: Cohen, your not even part of the plan, we're jus letting you push a cart
Marissa: ok Sum you're on
(Marissa, Summer and Seth walk around the corner to a nurse's station)
