    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer disagreed with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control because the User Interface suggested a round shape, while the Industrial Designer preferred a more traditional and simple design, possibly with a rectangular shape, to make it easier to use and more familiar to users.",
    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components for the remote control focuses on energy, material, and interface. The team considers three options for energy: simple battery, traditional solar cells, and a combination of both. They decide to use a simple battery. The material options are titanium and rubber. The team decides to use titanium for the casing and rubber for parts that require flexibility and comfort. The interface options are push buttons and a display. They decide to use simple push buttons and a display, with the option to include a backlight. The team also discusses the trend of making remote controls more \"fancy\" and \"spongy\" in shape, similar to fruit. They consider using a combination of titanium and rubber to achieve this look. The discussion also touches on the importance of keeping the remote control simple and easy to use, with a limited number of buttons and a clear display. The team decides to stick with a classical design and not reinvent the wheel.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that trends are quite the same in many areas, and they can travel from one thing to another, such as from clothes to furniture. They also learned that people are more interested in having a fancy look and feel in a remote control, and that the trend is to have a spongy or fruit-shaped remote control, rather than a traditional remote control with buttons. Additionally, they learned that people tend to change their TV more often than their remote control batteries, so it's better to design a remote control that is easy to use and has a simple design, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion about appearance design for the remote control focused on two main aspects: material and shape. The team considered using titanium for the body of the remote control, which is strong, durable, and can be made to have a unique shape. However, they also discussed the idea of using a spongy, fruit-shaped design, which would be more aesthetically pleasing and in line with current trends. The team agreed that the remote control should have a simple and user-friendly design, with a limited number of buttons, and that the LCD screen should be kept as a classical design, with a fixed layout and no touch-sensitive features. The team also considered the use of different colors, with the option to make the remote control available in various colors, including fruit-inspired colors, for an additional fee. The discussion highlighted the importance of creating a unique and desirable design that sets the product apart from others in the market.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a final design meeting for a remote control device shaped like a banana. The team discussed the design, its features, and its functionality. They presented a prototype and discussed the user interface, which included a scrolling wheel, buttons, and a display. The team also discussed the production costs and evaluated the design against the evaluation criteria. They decided to keep the design and make some minor changes to stay within the budget. The team evaluated the project and discussed the process, noting that it was productive and that they worked well together. They also discussed the design's potential for patenting and the use of Play-Doh for drawing. The meeting concluded with the team completing the final questionnaire and meeting summary.",
    "va-gq-93": "The Children, Young People and Education Committee held a meeting with the Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, to discuss the Welsh Government's childcare offer. The Minister provided an update on the progress of the scheme, which aims to provide 30 hours of free childcare for 3- to 4-year-olds from low-income families. The Minister reported that the scheme is being rolled out in early implementer local authority areas, with the goal of expanding it to all areas by 2020.\n\nThe Minister discussed the challenges faced by the scheme, including the administrative burden on providers and the need for communication with parents and local authorities. He also highlighted the importance of workforce development and capacity building to support the roll-out of the scheme.\n\nThe Minister addressed concerns about the \u00a34.50 hourly rate, which some Members felt was too low, particularly in areas with high living costs. He acknowledged that the rate may need to be adjusted in the future, but emphasized that the scheme's focus on working parents and the need for simplicity and transparency were key considerations.\n\nThe Minister also discussed the impact of the scheme on child development, with some Members expressing concerns about the potential for it to exacerbate existing inequalities. He argued that the scheme would benefit disadvantaged families and provide them with more choices and flexibility.\n\nThe Minister touched on the integration of the Welsh Government's childcare offer with the UK Government's tax-free childcare offer and the need for clear communication with parents and providers.\n\nFinally, the Minister and the officials agreed to meet in private to discuss further.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that there is a global trend of teacher recruitment and retention issues, not just in Wales but also in other countries such as the US, Australia, and Finland. She attributed the issue to various factors, including the fact that money alone is not enough to attract and retain teachers. She mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, including making sure that Welsh language skills are kept alive through teacher training, and increasing financial incentives for teachers who teach through the medium of Welsh. She also mentioned that the Welsh Government is working with ITE providers to develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language skills among all primary and secondary ITE entrants.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Welsh Government Minister, expressed concern about the pay dispute situation in the Further Education (FE) sector, particularly with regards to non-teaching staff. She acknowledged that the issue is not just about pay, but also about the impact on the sector's ability to recruit and retain staff. Morgan stated that the Welsh Government is keeping a close eye on the situation and is aware of the trade union's requests, but she did not commit to taking any further action to support the colleges or underwrite their costs. She emphasized that the issue is a matter for the colleges to negotiate with the trade unions, and the Welsh Government will wait until they come to a conclusion before responding. Morgan also highlighted the need for pay equality between teaching and non-teaching staff, but did not provide any indication that the Welsh Government would take steps to address this issue.",
    "va-sq-125": "Vaughan Gething stated that the perinatal mental health service was still in operation and that they were working to ensure that the service was maintained, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. He also mentioned that the service had been expanded to provide online support where possible, and that they were working to ensure that pregnant women received the support they needed.",

    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed the Aurora speech recognition system and its performance on the Meeting Recorder digits dataset. The team compared the performance of the Aurora system to the SRI system, which was trained on the TI-digits dataset. They found that the Aurora system had a slightly better performance, with a 2.7% error rate compared to the SRI system's 2.9% error rate. The team also discussed the use of various noise reduction techniques, including spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and VTS (Vector-based Speech Transformation System). They considered the pros and cons of these techniques and how they might be combined to improve the system's performance. Additionally, they discussed the use of VAD (Voice Activity Detection) and the importance of accurately detecting speech in noisy environments. The team also touched on the topic of subspace methods and the potential for combining different techniques to improve the system's performance.",
    "va-sq-179": "Marketing talked about market trend findings. They mentioned that they did trend-watching and found that younger people are looking for soft materials, primary colours, and a theme of fruit and vegetables for clothes, shoes, and products. They also mentioned that older people prefer dark colours, simple shapes, and familiar materials, such as wood. Marketing also discussed that the younger market is looking for something new and different, and that the design should be easy to use and not too expensive.",
    "va-sq-184": "The government's plan towards structural change in the higher education sector in Wales, as discussed during the meeting, is to encourage institutions to consider structural change as a solution to the financial challenges facing the sector. This could involve closing or merging departments, but the Minister emphasized that institutions are not currently at risk of collapse and that the goal is to manage the challenges rather than allow them to become a crisis. The government is also working with institutions to help them prepare for the changes and to ensure that they can meet their commitments to students. The Minister stated that the sector's ability to adapt to change is crucial, and that HEFCW is committed to supporting institutions in this process.",
    "va-sq-186": "Dr David Blaney stated that there isn't a specific solution to risk appetite, but rather a need for governing bodies to engage in a process of independent review of governance in Wales. He emphasized that the role of governing bodies becomes even more significant in times of increased contextual pressures. While HEFCW provides guidance and oversight, it's ultimately up to the governing bodies to make informed decisions. He also mentioned that the sector has a tendency to second-guess itself, but that's not necessarily a governance failure. Instead, it's a natural part of the process.",
    "va-sq-216": "The Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be colourful, small, and not too big, with a simple design that is easy to use, especially for children. They also suggested that the remote control could have a unique design that stands out from other remote controls, and that it should be easy to distinguish from other devices. The Industrial Designer also mentioned that the design should be adaptable, with options for different user preferences, such as a \"previous\" or \"history\" button to allow users to undo previous actions.",
    "va-sq-219": "The target price, target cost, and target profit of the remote control are not explicitly stated in the provided transcript. However, it can be inferred that the project manager mentions that the finance people estimate that they need production costs of a maximum of \u20ac12.50 to reach the profit target, and that the remote control will be sold for \u20ac25 each. This implies that the target profit is the difference between the selling price and the production cost, which is \u20ac25 - \u20ac12.50 = \u20ac12.50.",
    "va-sq-225": "The conversation discusses the use of microphones in a meeting. The group is considering using wireless microphones, specifically the Crown Mics, which are $350 each. However, they are proprietary and require a custom-made adapter, which would add $40 to the cost. The group is also considering using a different headset with a built-in antenna, which would eliminate the need for a separate receiver. The issue is that the headset would need to be clipped to the speaker's collar, which could be inconvenient. The group decides to order nine Crown Mics, which is the maximum number they can support, and considers using a digital audio recorder for the meeting. The group also discusses the use of echo cancellation to handle overlapping talk and the potential for using spectroanalysis to analyze the audio.",

    "va-sq-258": "The professor didn't explicitly state their thoughts on positional parameters. However, it can be inferred that they were discussing the idea of using positional parameters in speech recognition, and they seemed to be open to the idea. When PhD B mentioned that Mark Randolph used positional parameters in his research, the professor didn't have a strong reaction, and they didn't seem to have any major objections to the idea. In fact, they were more interested in exploring how to implement and use positional parameters in their own research.",
    "va-sq-264": "The decision on the remote control design features is as follows:\n\n* The remote control should have a simple and intuitive design with a limited number of buttons to avoid confusion.\n* The remote control should have a weight that is not too heavy to prevent it from breaking easily.\n* The buttons should not be too small, making it easy to use.\n* The remote control should have a feature that indicates when a button is pressed, such as a LED light.\n* The remote control should be made of a material that is not too expensive, such as plastic.\n* The remote control should be designed to be compatible with as many devices as possible.\n* The remote control should not require frequent battery replacements.\n* The design should also consider the user experience and make it look nice and visually appealing, as it will be sold on the company's website."
