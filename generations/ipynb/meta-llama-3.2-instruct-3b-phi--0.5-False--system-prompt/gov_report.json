The IDFC is designed to promote private investment in developing and transition countries, complementing U.S. development assistance objectives and foreign policy interests. Its mission is to provide financing, guarantees, and other forms of support to private sector investments in support of U.S. global development goals and economic interests.\n\nThe IDFC will consolidate and replace the functions of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and certain elements of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The agency will have the authority to make loans, guarantees, and issue insurance or reinsurance, as well as take minority equity positions in investments. The IDFC will prioritize support for less-developed countries and will have a performance measurement system to evaluate and monitor its projects.\n\nThe IDFC's organizational structure and management will be overseen by a Board of Directors, which will include the Secretary of State, USAID Administrator, Secretary of the Treasury, and four non-governmental members appointed by the President. The agency will have its own Inspector General and will be required to establish a Risk Committee and Audit Committee to ensure monitoring and oversight of its investment strategies and finances.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be subject to certain limitations, including a maximum contingent liability of $60 billion and a requirement to give preferential consideration to projects sponsored by U.S. persons. The agency will also be required to consider the impact of its support on women's economic opportunities and outcomes and to ensure that its support does not distort the market.\n\nThe IDFC is expected to become operational in early 2019, and will replace OPIC. The agency's implementation will be overseen by Congress, which may consider policy issues related to the IDFC's capacity limits, authorities, and policy parameters. The IDFC's role in promoting U.S. trade and investment efforts will be similar to that of the Export-Import Bank and the Trade and Development Agency.\n\nThe IDFC's mission and operations will be guided by the BUILD Act, which aims to promote private sector investment in developing and transition countries. The agency's performance will be evaluated through a performance measurement system, and it will be required to report to Congress on its activities and impact.",
    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The TANF block grant was designed to provide a block of funds to states to support their efforts to help needy families achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nPrior to the creation of TANF, the AFDC program was established in 1935 and provided cash assistance to needy families with children. However, the program was criticized for its limitations, including the requirement that single mothers work to receive benefits, which was not always feasible. The AFDC program also had a caseload reduction credit, which allowed states to reduce their caseloads by counting recipients who left the program for work.\n\nThe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 made significant changes to the AFDC program, including the elimination of the caseload reduction credit and the introduction of the TANF block grant. The TANF block grant provided states with a block of funds to support their efforts to help needy families achieve self-sufficiency, and states were required to implement TANF and accept their block grant funding by July 1, 1997.\n\nThe TANF block grant was designed to promote work and self-sufficiency among needy families, and states were required to use the funds to provide services such as child care, job training, and education. The block grant also included provisions to promote healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, and to prevent cash assistance to unwed minor mothers.\n\nSince the creation of TANF, there have been several reauthorizations and amendments to the block grant, including the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These laws have made changes to the block grant, including the elimination of the TANF bonus funds and the introduction of a new database to track the effectiveness of TANF programs.\n\nToday, TANF remains a critical source of funding for states to support their efforts to help needy families achieve self-sufficiency. The block grant continues to be a key component of the federal response to poverty and economic insecurity, and its impact on family well-being and economic mobility continues to be studied by researchers and policymakers.\n\nThe TANF block grant has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it has",
    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin is a vital water resource that spans over 246,000 square miles across seven states in the United States and Mexico. The Bureau of Reclamation, a part of the Department of the Interior, plays a crucial role in managing the basin's waters. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework for apportioning water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the dividing line at Lee Ferry, Arizona. The compact also authorized the construction of major water storage and conveyance facilities, including the Hoover Dam and the All-American Canal.\n\nThe Colorado River is used for various purposes, including industrial, agricultural, municipal, and recreational activities. A majority of the water supplies are used for irrigation, with 5.5 million acres of land irrigated. The river also provides habitat for a wide range of species, including several federally endangered species. The river flows through 7 national wildlife refuges and 11 National Park Service units, supporting important recreational opportunities.\n\nHowever, the Colorado River is facing significant challenges, including drought, climate change, and over-allocation of water resources. The 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest period in more than 100 years, with natural flows averaging only 12.4 million acre-feet per year. The current drought has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of the river's water supplies.\n\nTo address these challenges, Congress has implemented various measures, including the 2007 Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead. These guidelines require Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and contribute additional water to Lake Mead storage at predetermined trigger elevations. The Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan, finalized in 2019, includes commitments for delivery cutbacks by California and other states, with the goal of reducing the risk of Lake Mead falling below 1,020 feet.\n\nCongress also plays a crucial role in funding and overseeing existing facilities and programs, including the Colorado River Storage Projects and the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Program. The Pilot System Conservation Program aims to conserve water supplies through voluntary conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, Congress has approved Indian water rights settlements and plans for new and augmented water storage, including the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. The ongoing drought has highlighted the need for increased water storage and conservation efforts, and Congress may consider new legislation to address these challenges and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Colorado River Basin.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows individuals to sue the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees. The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity from certain types of claims, enabling individuals to seek compensation for injuries or damages caused by the government's negligence or wrongdoing. The law provides a mechanism for victims of government wrongdoing to obtain justice and deter tortious conduct by federal personnel.\n\nThe FTCA applies to torts committed by federal employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment. However, it does not apply to torts committed by independent contractors or private individuals. The law also excludes certain types of claims, such as those arising from the exercise of discretion or policy, and those that would create a conflict with federal policy or interfere with specific objectives of federal legislation.\n\nThe FTCA has several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the law enforcement proviso, the foreign country exception, and the military exceptions. The discretionary function exception shields the government from liability for conduct that involves the exercise of judgment or choice, while the law enforcement proviso waives immunity for certain intentional torts committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. The foreign country exception preserves the government's immunity for claims arising in a foreign country, and the military exceptions shield the government from liability for injuries to servicemen arising out of or incident to military service.\n\nThe FTCA also imposes procedural requirements, including a statute of limitations and exhaustion provisions, to ensure that claims are properly processed and resolved. The law requires plaintiffs to submit their claims to the relevant federal agency, which must deny the claim before the plaintiff can file a lawsuit in federal court. If the agency denies the claim, the plaintiff has six months to file a lawsuit before the claim is forever barred.\n\nLegislative proposals have been made to amend the FTCA, including proposals to broaden the waiver of sovereign immunity, to create new exceptions, or to modify the existing exceptions. Some proposals aim to allow servicemembers to sue the United States for certain injuries arising from military service, while others propose alternative compensation mechanisms for injured servicemembers. Private bills have also been introduced to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it provides an inadequate mechanism for victims of government wrongdoing to obtain justice, while others argue that it shields the government from liability and undermines the rule of law.

However, a review of these buildings found that some design choices have increased operational and maintenance (O&M) costs, while others have decreased costs.\n\nDesign choices that have decreased O&M costs include the use of natural light, durable and easily maintained materials and finishes, and native landscaping. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles features a light well and serrated glass fa\u00e7ade that maximizes natural light, reducing energy costs. Similarly, the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, uses travertine stone for its lobby walls and floors, which has lasted over 15 years without requiring repairs.\n\nOn the other hand, design choices that have increased O&M costs include multistory atriums and lobbies, large custom windows, and mission spaces with complex mechanical systems. For instance, the Albert Armendariz, Sr., U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, Texas, has a three-story window wall and front atrium that provide ample light, but also require expensive scaffolding and maintenance. Similarly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Satellite Operations Facility has a fa\u00e7ade that is expensive to maintain and repair, but is not accessible to the public.\n\nGSA does not fully consider O&M and functionality when making design choices, and does not estimate or gather all perspectives from building and regional managers on the full O&M costs of design choices. This lack of consideration can result in costly design choices that may not be functional or accessible to the public. For example, the U.S. Secret Service Headquarters and FBI field office buildings restrict public access to interior spaces, despite being visible from public sidewalks or roads.\n\nTo address these issues, we recommend that GSA update its procedures to require officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. Additionally, GSA should consider the functional benefits of design choices and ensure that they are accessible to the public.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted a review of the Department of Defense's (DOD) excess controlled property (LESO) program, which allows federal law enforcement agencies to acquire excess equipment and supplies from the DOD. The review found that the program has been beneficial to law enforcement agencies, with many reporting cost savings and improved capabilities. However, the GAO also identified several weaknesses in the program's management, oversight, and accountability processes.\n\nThe GAO found that the DOD has taken some steps to address weaknesses in the LESO program, including revising policies and procedures for the approval and disapproval of law enforcement agency property requests and the transfer of LESO property. However, the GAO identified significant deficiencies in the program's internal controls, including a lack of verification and approval of federal agency applications and a lack of risk assessment.\n\nThe GAO's review highlighted several areas for improvement, including the need for DLA to review and revise policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with the transfer of controlled property, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe DOD has concurred with the GAO's recommendations and has taken steps to address the identified weaknesses. However, the GAO's review highlights the need for continued oversight and improvement in the LESO program to ensure that it is operating effectively and efficiently.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a federal agency responsible for reviewing foreign acquisitions of US businesses to determine whether they pose a threat to national security. Established in 1975, CFIUS is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes representatives from various government agencies. The committee reviews transactions involving foreign persons that could result in foreign control of a US business engaged in interstate commerce.\n\nThe report highlights the increasing workload of CFIUS, with a 55% increase in covered transactions reviewed between 2011 and 2016. The committee has experienced a modest increase in staff, but member agency officials expressed concerns about the ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures.\n\nThe report also notes that the complexity of CFIUS reviews has increased, with more transactions involving emerging technologies, complex corporate arrangements, and non-traditional threats. The committee reviews transactions from a wide range of industries, with the manufacturing sector accounting for the largest share.\n\nThe report identifies several factors that CFIUS considers when evaluating the national security risks posed by transactions, including the potential effects on US critical technologies, the potential for transshipment or diversion of technologies with military applications, and the relevant foreign country's record of adherence to nonproliferation control regimes.\n\nThe report concludes that CFIUS faces challenges in addressing its workload and recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury coordinate with member agencies to better understand staffing levels needed to complete core committee functions. The report also notes that the committee's workload may increase with potential changes to CFIUS authorities, and that additional staff may be necessary to address these challenges.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the importance of CFIUS in protecting US national security interests through the review of foreign acquisitions, while also acknowledging the challenges faced by the committee in addressing its workload and ensuring that it can effectively complete its core functions.",

    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The civil aviation industry in the United States is comprised of two main categories: general aviation and commercial aviation. General aviation includes all aviation activities other than military and commercial airlines, and is where most civilian pilot students undergo their initial pilot training. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates the safety of civil aviation in the United States, including the administration of pilot certification and conducting safety oversight of pilot training.\n\nThere are three main types of pilot schools: collegiate aviation schools, non-collegiate vocational pilot schools, and non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools. Collegiate aviation schools offer a 2- or 4-year undergraduate degree in an aviation-based major along with the pilot certificates and ratings necessary to become a commercial pilot. Non-collegiate vocational pilot schools do not allow flexible training environments, while non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools offer flexible training environments.\n\nTo become an airline pilot, an individual must undergo extensive training and meet specific requirements, including obtaining a medical certificate, a student pilot certificate, and a commercial pilot certificate, instrument rating, and multi-engine rating. The FAA requires pilots to have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight experience to become an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate.\n\nThe cost of flight training is a significant challenge for some colleges and universities, with the maximum federal financial aid available to eligible students being below the full cost of a collegiate flight education. Many students rely on private loans, which can be difficult to secure, and some students may not be able to afford the cost of collegiate flight training.\n\nCollegiate aviation schools face several challenges, including recruiting and retaining flight instructors, purchasing and maintaining aircraft, and navigating the complexities of federal student financial aid and veterans' education benefits. The FAA's regulations and policies can also create challenges for these schools, such as the requirement to publish specific training hours and costs for each flight course.\n\nDespite these challenges, many collegiate aviation schools are working to address these issues and provide students with the training and support they need to become successful pilots. Some schools are offering scholarships and financial aid to help students cover the cost of flight training, and others are working with airlines to provide students with job opportunities after graduation.\n\nThe airline industry is facing a pilot shortage, with some airlines struggling to find qualified pilots to fill their ranks. This shortage is expected to worsen in the coming years, with the FAA estimating that there will be a shortage of 20,000 pilots by 2025. To address this shortage, the industry is exploring alternative training programs, such as cadet"
