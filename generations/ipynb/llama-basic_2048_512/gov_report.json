These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans. The federal crop insurance program, administered by the USDA's Risk Management Agency, protects crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, plant diseases, and declines in commodity prices. The NAP program provides financial assistance to farmers and ranchers who suffer crop losses due to natural disasters.\n\nThe 2018 farm bill made several amendments to these programs, including expanding crop eligibility, increasing payment limits, and creating separate payment limits for catastrophic and buy-up coverage. The bill also expanded the definition of eligible producers to include Indian tribes and tribal organizations. The Supplemental Agriculture Disaster Assistance Program, established by the 2018 farm bill, provides additional assistance to farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters.\n\nIn addition to these programs, the USDA can use existing authority to provide assistance to farmers and ranchers. For example, the agency can use its authority under the Animal Health Protection Act to take protective actions against the spread of livestock disease. The USDA can also use its authority to provide emergency loans to farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters.\n\nThe 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered by existing programs. The Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program, established by the act, provides financial assistance to farmers and ranchers who suffered crop losses due to wildfires and hurricanes in 2017. The program offers payments ranging from 70% to 95% of the expected value of the crop, depending on the level of coverage purchased.\n\nOverall, the USDA's disaster assistance programs provide critical support to farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters, helping them to recover from financial losses and get back on their feet.",

However, the department has struggled with persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts, which has negatively impacted its ability to carry out its mission.\n\nAs of March 2018, the department had a total of 655 staffed positions at overseas posts, but 170 Foreign Service employees were not staffed to one of the six regional bureaus. The largest specialist skill groups at overseas posts were in the Security Officer category, with 655 staffed positions.\n\nThe department's efforts to address vacancies have been hindered by a lack of an integrated action plan to identify the root causes of persistent vacancies and suggest corrective measures. The department relies on a variety of methods to fill vacancies, including using shorter-term assignments to fill positions at high-priority posts. However, this approach has led to inaccuracies in the department's personnel data, with some positions appearing vacant when they are actually filled by temporary employees.\n\nThe department's reliance on shorter-term assignments has also led to a mismatch between the number of vacant positions and the actual number of unstaffed posts. For example, the department reported 25 vacant positions at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan, but only 10 were actually unstaffed.\n\nThe department's lack of an integrated action plan has also hindered its ability to address the root causes of vacancies. The department's Five Year Workforce and Leadership Succession Plan: Fiscal Years 2016-2020 and Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review identify strategic human capital management as a high-risk issue, but do not provide a clear plan for addressing vacancies.\n\nTo address these issues, the department should develop an integrated action plan that identifies the root causes of persistent vacancies and suggests corrective measures.
