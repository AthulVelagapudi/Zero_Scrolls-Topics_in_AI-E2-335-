The IDFC is authorized to mobilize and facilitate private sector capital and skills in developing and transition countries to support U.S. development assistance and foreign policy objectives. The IDFC's mission is to promote private investment in support of both U.S. global development goals and U.S. economic interests.\n\nThe IDFC will consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions, which are currently carried out primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The IDFC will have the authority to make loans and guarantees, issue insurance or reinsurance, and take minority equity positions in investments. The IDFC will also conduct feasibility studies and provide technical assistance.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be guided by a performance measurement system that will evaluate and monitor its projects and guide future project support. The IDFC will be required to submit annual reports to Congress on its economic and social development impact, as well as its compliance with statutory requirements.\n\nThe IDFC will be managed by a Board of Directors, which will include representatives from the U.S. government and the private sector. The IDFC's Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation. The IDFC will also have a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Development Officer, who will report directly to the Board.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be subject to certain limitations, including a maximum contingent liability of $60 billion and a requirement to give preferential consideration to projects sponsored by or involving U.S. persons, as well as projects that promote worker rights, environmental and social safeguards, and international trade obligations.\n\nThe IDFC is expected to become operational by October 1, 2019, and will replace OPIC.

The 1996 law provided funding for TANF through FY2002 and made significant changes to the welfare system, including the elimination of the five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance, the prohibition on benefits for unwed minor parents, and the requirement that states implement a work requirement for recipients.\n\nSince 2002, TANF funding has been extended through a series of short-term continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations bills. The law has undergone several changes, including the elimination of performance bonuses to states, the establishment of a $150 million fund for research and competitive grants on healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, and the requirement that states verify work activities of recipients.\n\nIn 2019, the TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019, ending a funding gap that occurred after the expiration of P.L. 115-298 on December 21, 2018. The law also made several changes to the TANF program, including the elimination of the requirement for states to provide child care for recipients engaged in work activities and the prohibition on states from increasing cash benefits when a new baby is born to a family already on the rolls.\n\nOverall, the TANF program has undergone significant changes since its establishment in 1996, with a focus on promoting work and self-sufficiency among recipients.

The Bureau of Reclamation plays a crucial role in managing the basin's waters, with a focus on apportioning water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established the framework for water allocation, with the Lower Basin receiving 7.5 million acre-feet annually, while the Upper Basin provides 7.5 million acre-feet to the Lower Basin, with additional allocations to Mexico.\n\nThe compact has undergone several modifications, including the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, which authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and related facilities. The Arizona v. California decision in 1963 ruled in favor of Arizona, establishing the principle that the federal government would prioritize the allocation of Colorado River water to the Lower Basin. The Central Arizona Project (CAP) was authorized in 1968, providing water to Arizona's population centers.\n\nThe 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty established a framework for water sharing between the two countries, with Mexico receiving 1.5 million acre-feet annually. The Upper Basin Compact of 1948 allocated water rights among the Upper Basin states, with Colorado receiving the largest share. The Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 authorized storage reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin, while the 1968 CRBPA amended the CRSP to include additional projects.\n\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines and Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead aimed to reduce water use and increase storage in the Lower Basin during droughts. The 2012 Reclamation Study projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand, with decreasing flows and increasing demand. The 2019 Drought Contingency Plans, finalized by Reclamation and the basin states, aimed to reduce water use and increase storage in both the Upper and Lower Basins.\n\nThe plans include measures to reduce water use in the Lower Basin, such as curtailments in Arizona and Nevada, and to increase storage in Lake Mead. The plans also include provisions for voluntary conservation efforts and the storage of conserved water in the Upper Basin.

    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees or while engaged in federal activities. The law was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by the actions of federal employees or contractors. The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity from certain types of tort claims, allowing individuals to bring lawsuits against the government for damages.\n\nThe FTCA applies to torts committed by federal employees while acting within the scope of their employment, as well as to torts committed by federal employees while engaged in activities outside of their official duties. The law also applies to torts committed by independent contractors who are acting on behalf of the federal government.\n\nThe FTCA has several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the intentional tort exception, and the foreign country exception. The discretionary function exception applies to torts that involve the exercise of judgment or discretion, while the intentional tort exception applies to torts that are committed with the intent to harm or with substantial certainty of harm. The foreign country exception applies to torts committed in foreign countries.\n\nThe FTCA also has several procedural requirements, including a two-year statute of limitations and an exhaustion requirement, which requires individuals to file a claim with the relevant federal agency before filing a lawsuit. The law also limits the types and amount of damages that can be recovered, and prohibits the recovery of punitive damages or attorney's fees.\n\nThere have been several legislative proposals to amend the FTCA, including proposals to abrogate or modify the Feres doctrine, which shields the federal government from liability for injuries sustained by military personnel while in the course of their official duties. Some have argued that the Feres doctrine is unjust and should be abolished, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the military.\n\nIn addition to legislative proposals, Congress has the authority to enact private bills to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.",

The program is administered by the states, but is overseen by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Unemployment Insurance. The program's effectiveness depends on the ability of states to control benefit payments by accurately determining individuals' eligibility.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of work search requirements in the UI program. Work search requirements are a key factor in determining eligibility for UI benefits, and states have some flexibility in setting these requirements. However, the report found that some states have not consistently implemented work search requirements, and that the use of formal warnings to address non-compliance is inconsistent.\n\nThe report also found that states with formal warning policies reported lower work search overpayment rates, but that these policies are no longer permitted under federal law. The report recommends that the Department of Labor provide states with clear guidance on work search verification requirements and monitor state compliance.\n\nThe report analyzed data from the Department of Labor's Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) program, which reviews a sample of UI claims to determine the accuracy of benefit payments. The analysis found that states with higher percentages of claimants required to search for work had lower work search overpayment rates. States with more frequent use of formal warnings also had lower work search overpayment rates.\n\nThe report also found that states with more cases for which BAM auditors investigated job contacts had lower work search overpayment rates. The report suggests that states making a greater effort to investigate work search activities tend to have lower overpayment rate estimates associated with this issue.\n\nThe report concludes that the health of the UI program depends on the ability of states to control benefit payments by accurately determining individuals' eligibility.

VHA is the largest property holder within VA and is responsible for overseeing health care delivery to enrolled veterans and managing all VA medical facilities.\n\nVA's disposal process for vacant properties typically begins with VISNs and local facilities identifying underutilized and vacant properties, updating the Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) database, and developing a disposal plan. The plan may include options such as re-use, demolition, enhanced-use lease, or transfer to the General Services Administration (GSA). If no disposal options are feasible, VA may choose to close or \"mothball\" the property.\n\nVA has taken steps to enhance its disposal process, including establishing a working group to assist VISNs and local facilities in conducting environmental and historic reviews. However, challenges remain, including the time it takes to complete these reviews, which can take up to 5 years for historic reviews and 2 years for environmental reviews. Additionally, competing priorities for VA funds can hinder disposal efforts, and the lack of clear procedures for managing property disposals can make it difficult for VISNs and local facilities to navigate the process.\n\nVA has also faced challenges in tracking and monitoring the disposal of its vacant properties. The agency's Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) database does not currently collect detailed data on the status of disposal projects, including environmental and historic review documents. As a result, VA officials may not have a complete understanding of the disposal process and may not be able to identify areas where management can assist in disposing of vacant properties.\n\nTo address these challenges, we recommend that the Secretary develop clear procedures for each of VA's disposal options, collect data on disposal status information and time frames, and increase the capacity of the CAI to allow local facilities to upload disposal-specific documentation.",

However, a review of the program found that GSA's design choices have resulted in both decreased and increased operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.\n\n**Design Choices that Decreased O&M Costs**\n\nGSA's design choices have led to reduced O&M costs in some areas, such as:\n\n* Increased natural light, which has reduced energy costs\n* Durable and easily maintained materials and finishes, which have reduced maintenance costs\n* Low-maintenance landscaping, which has reduced water and energy costs\n\n**Design Choices that Increased O&M Costs**\n\nOn the other hand, design choices have led to increased O&M costs in some areas, such as:\n\n* Multistory atriums and lobbies, which have increased repair, cleaning, and energy costs\n* Custom windows, which have increased repair and maintenance costs\n* Mission spaces, which have increased repair and cleaning costs\n* Separate structures, which have increased maintenance costs\n* Energy-efficient elements, such as solar panels and green roofs, which have increased repair costs\n\n**GSA's Lack of Consideration of O&M Costs**\n\nGSA does not fully consider O&M costs during the planning and design stage of new projects. The agency estimates only one-third of O&M costs, leaving two-thirds to be estimated later in the process. This lack of consideration can lead to costly design changes and increased O&M costs.\n\n**GSA's Process for Sharing Information on Design Choices**\n\nGSA does not systematically collect and share information on the O&M costs of design choices in existing buildings. The agency relies on informal feedback from building managers and officials, but this information is not consistently collected or shared.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe report recommends that GSA update its procedures to:\n\n1. Estimate full O&M costs during the planning and design process\n2. Obtain input from building managers and officials on O&M costs and functionality\n3. Consider the impact of design choices on building functionality, including public visibility and accessibility\n4. Systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Design Excellence Program has achieved excellence in architecture and design, but GSA's lack of consideration of O&M costs and lack of systematic information sharing can lead to increased",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense's (DOD) Excess Controlled Property (LESO) program allows federal law enforcement agencies to acquire excess property from the DOD at no cost. The program has been used for various law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security efforts. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the program has several weaknesses in its processes for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk.\n\nThe GAO report found that DOD's internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency applications were inadequate, as DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and did not conduct site visits to verify the legitimacy of applications. The report also found that DLA's internal controls for transferring property were weak, as personnel did not verify the quantity of approved items before transfer, and did not maintain accurate accountability records.\n\nThe GAO report also found that DLA lacked a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures, and had not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program. The report made four recommendations to DOD to address these weaknesses, including reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with DOD's guidance on transferring controlled property, issuing guidance on verifying the type and quantity of approved items, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe DOD concurred with all of the GAO's recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. The LESO program has been used to acquire property for various law enforcement activities, including search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, and serving warrants. The program has also been used to acquire property for training purposes, such as the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles used by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to rescue people from floodwaters.\n\nOverall, the GAO report highlights the need for DOD to strengthen its internal controls and implement a comprehensive framework for preventing and mitigating fraud in the LESO program.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "**Summary of the Report: Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)**\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a government agency responsible for reviewing foreign investments in the United States to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security. The report examines the changes in CFIUS's workload and staffing from 2011 to 2016, and provides information on stakeholder views on potential changes to CFIUS.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* CFIUS's workload has increased significantly, with the number of covered transactions reviewed increasing from 111 in 2011 to 172 in 2016, a 55% increase.\n* The complexity of CFIUS reviews has also increased, with more transactions involving new and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics.\n* Staffing levels have not kept pace with the increase in workload, with CFIUS member agencies reporting that they are limited in their ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures.\n* Stakeholders have expressed concerns about the potential for CFIUS to be overwhelmed by an increased workload, which could limit its ability to fulfill its objectives and address national security threats.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe report recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, coordinate member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions.\n\n**Stakeholder Views:**\n\nStakeholders, including CFIUS member agencies, nonmember agencies, and external experts, have expressed a range of views on potential changes to CFIUS, including altering the structure of the committee, redefining which transactions should be considered for review, and expanding the list of factors CFIUS considers. Most stakeholders are satisfied with the existing structure of CFIUS, but some have concerns about the potential for increased workload and the need for additional staffing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe report highlights the need for CFIUS to address its increasing workload and staffing challenges to ensure it can effectively review foreign investments and protect national security. The report's findings and recommendations are intended to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the current state of CFIUS and its challenges, and to promote a more effective and efficient review process.",
    "gao_GAO-18-7": "**Combating Wildlife Trafficking: A Summary of the National Strategy and Efforts**\n\nThe National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking and Reducing Demand, implemented in 2014, aims to reduce the demand for illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products. The strategy identifies reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife as a top priority, with a focus on raising public awareness and changing consumption patterns.\n\n**Global Efforts**\n\nThe United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia are major markets for illegally traded wildlife. The global wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $7 billion annually, with the majority of the trade occurring in Asia. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Endangered Species Act have been implemented to regulate the trade.\n\n**U.S. Efforts**\n\nThe U.S. government agencies involved in combating wildlife trafficking include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These agencies have implemented various programs and initiatives to reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife, including awareness-raising campaigns, law enforcement efforts, and capacity-building programs.\n\n**Demand for Illegal Wildlife and Wildlife Products**\n\nThe demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products is diverse and widespread. In the United States, the top 10 wildlife shipments seized by FWS between 2007 and 2016 included coral, crocodile, conch, deer, python, sea turtle, mollusks, ginseng, clam, and seahorse. In Asia, the demand for wildlife is driven by a desire for rare and exotic species, as well as a perception of luxury and status.\n\n**Challenges and Opportunities**\n\nDespite efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, disagreements on roles and responsibilities among agencies have hindered some CWT activities in Southeast Asia. The lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities has led to fragmented efforts and confusion among foreign governments. To address this issue, the U.S. government agencies involved in combating wildlife trafficking should clarify their roles and responsibilities and work together to ensure a coordinated effort.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the findings of this report, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Interior should work with the Task Force to clarify roles and responsibilities of mission staff engaged in collaborative efforts on combating wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia.\n2. The Secretary of State should work with the Task Force to clarify roles and responsibilities of mission staff engaged in collaborative efforts on combating wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia.\n3",
    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The report highlights the challenges faced by collegiate aviation schools in producing professional pilots. The main categories of collegiate aviation schools are collegiate aviation schools, non-collegiate vocational pilot schools, and non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools. Collegiate aviation schools offer a 2- or 4-year undergraduate degree in an aviation-based major along with the pilot certificates and ratings necessary to become a commercial pilot. These schools must comply with FAA's pilot training requirements, but some may elect to become FAA-certificated as well.\n\nThe report notes that the cost of flight training is a significant challenge for some colleges in recruiting and retaining students. The cost of a professional pilot degree program can exceed $100,000, and many students rely on private loans or family resources to finance their education. The report also highlights the importance of retaining flight instructors, as they are a key challenge for collegiate aviation schools. The FAA requires flight instructors to have a minimum of 2 years of experience before they can train other pilots to become certified flight instructors.\n\nThe report also notes that the revised first officer requirements have helped collegiate aviation schools retain flight instructors. The school representatives stated that while they are still experiencing high flight instructor turnover, the situation would be more challenging without the new requirements. The report also highlights the importance of addressing the challenge of recruiting and retaining flight instructors, as well as the need for more affordable flight training options.\n\nThe report concludes that the collegiate aviation industry faces several challenges, including the cost of flight training, the need to retain flight instructors, and the need for more affordable flight training options. The report recommends that the FAA and industry stakeholders work together to address these challenges and provide more support for collegiate aviation schools."
