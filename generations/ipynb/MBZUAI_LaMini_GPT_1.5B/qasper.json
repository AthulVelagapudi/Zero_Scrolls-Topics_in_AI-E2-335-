Sadness: The intensity of sadness was determined by the number of positive and negative words in the tweet.\n\nThe training data was translated into the four subtasks using a machine learning algorithm that uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The algorithm uses a combination of techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering to analyze the data and determine the intensity of emotions. The training data was preprocessed by cleaning and preprocessing the text, removing stop words, stemming, and stemming, and converting the text into a format suitable for machine learning.
