It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children\u2014specifically, those headed by single mothers\u2014that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The federal government plays a prominent role in the management of the basin's waters, which are primarily used for irrigation and M&I purposes. The basin's water supplies are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation, and are managed through a variety of water storage and conveyance facilities. The river's flow and stored water are also important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The basin's water supplies are used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land, and the water supply to nearly 40 million people is provided through a majority of the basin's water supplies. The river's flow and stored water are also important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The river's flow and stored water are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation in the Lower Basin, and the federal government's role in the management of the basin's waters is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin. The federal government's role in the management of the Colorado River water is significant, and the federal government's role in the management of the basin's waters is elevated by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin.",

    "crs_R45237": "The report provides an overview of the FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Commerce accounts. It also provides an overview of the enacted FY2018 appropriations for agencies and bureaus funded as part of annual CJS appropriations. The report also provides historical funding trends for CJS. The dollar amounts in this report reflect only new funding made available at the start of the fiscal year. Therefore, the amounts do not include any rescissions of unobligated or deobligated balances that may be counted as offsets to newly enacted appropriations, nor do they include any scorekeeping adjustments (e.g., the budgetary effects of provisions limiting the availability of the balance in the Crime Victims Fund). In the text of the report, appropriations are rounded to the nearest million. However, percentage changes are calculated using whole, not rounded, numbers, meaning that in some instances there may be small differences between the actual percentage change and the percentage change that would be calculated by using the rounded amounts presented in the report.",
    "crs_RS21212": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers several programs designed to help farmers and ranchers recover from the financial effects of natural disasters, including federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), and emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers. All have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program is the only one requiring a federal disaster designation (see Table 1). Most programs receive mandatory funding amounts of \"such sums as necessary\" and are not subject to annual discretionary appropriations. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ) made a number of amendments to these programs, generally to expand availability and support. Prior to the creation of many of the permanently authorized programs at USDA, Congress had historically provided farmers and ranchers with ad hoc disaster assistance payments authorized through supplemental appropriations. Subsequently, policies shifted away from the temporary forms of assistance in favor of enacting more permanent forms of support. More recently, policies have shifted to supplement permanent programs with ad hoc assistance for select agriculture losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) amended existing disaster assistance programs and authorized $2.36 billion for production losses from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 that were not covered by existing programs.",

The complex includes 16 sites that were created during World War II and the Cold War to research, produce, and test nuclear weapons. The cleanup activities at these sites involve a complex set of laws, agencies, and administrative steps. The cleanup responsibilities of EM are derived from different laws, including CERCLA, RCRA, the Atomic Energy Act, and state hazardous waste laws. Federal facility agreements, compliance orders, and other compliance agreements also govern this cleanup. Federal facility agreements are generally enforceable agreements that DOE enters into with EPA and affected states under CERCLA and applicable state laws. For each federal facility listed on the National Priorities List, EPA\u2019s list of seriously contaminated sites, section 120 of CERCLA requires the relevant federal agency to enter into an interagency agreement with EPA for the completion of all necessary cleanup actions at the facility. The interagency agreement must include, among other things, the selection of the cleanup action and schedule for its completion. Interagency agreement provisions can be renegotiated, as necessary, to incorporate new information, adjust schedules, and address changing conditions.",

The federal-state UI program provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Under this arrangement, states administer their own programs according to certain federal requirements and under the oversight of DOL\u2019s Office of Unemployment Insurance. States have considerable flexibility to set benefit amounts and their duration, or the maximum period of time that the state pays benefits, and establish eligibility requirements. UI benefits are funded primarily through state payroll taxes on employers, and administrative costs are primarily funded through a federal payroll tax on employers. The states collect taxes that will be used to pay UI benefits, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury holds these funds in trust on behalf of the states in the Unemployment Trust Fund. DOL certifies for payment to the states administrative grants to operate their UI programs, which amounted to about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. DOL is responsible for ensuring that state UI laws include certain provisions, which is a condition of the state receiving its UI administrative grant. UI claimants typically claim their UI benefits by filing claims with their state UI agency online or by phone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
