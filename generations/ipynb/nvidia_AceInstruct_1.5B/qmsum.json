She mentioned that the number of teachers being recruited is only about 65 per cent of the targets, and that there is a need for a whole package of measures to address the issue. She highlighted the importance of making sure that Welsh teacher training is world-class and emphasized the need for financial incentives, including a new financial incentive of \u00a320,000 a year for graduates with the highest qualifications. She also mentioned the establishment of an advisory board to address recruitment and retention issues and the upcoming evaluation of Welsh-medium provision inITE. Additionally, she discussed the need for part-time PGCE routes to allow students to balance work and education, and she acknowledged the importance of building confidence in Welsh language skills among students. She also noted that the Welsh Government is committed to maintaining and growing funding for part-time education, despite the \u00a312.5 million reduction from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales. She emphasized the need for parity of esteem in post-16 education and the importance of collaboration between institutions. She also mentioned the need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds and the potential for more university mergers if they would benefit students. She stated that there is no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers, but there is a desire for collaboration between institutions. She also mentioned the importance of making sure that the student's needs are prioritized in any future policy discussions. She concluded by stating that the Welsh Government is committed to the Diamond reforms and the need for a strong and sustainable HE sector. [Lynne Neagle AM: Llyr. Llyr Gruffydd AM: You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh.

I mean, it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education.

The target cost and profit are essential considerations for the design team to ensure that the remote control meets both quality and profitability standards. The target cost is calculated based on the production costs, which include materials, labor, and overhead expenses, while the target profit is determined by the difference between the selling price and the total cost of production. The target cost is crucial for ensuring that the product is affordable while still being profitable, and the target profit is a key metric for evaluating the success of the project.

    "va-sq-225": "The discussion about microphone data focused on the challenges of using different types of microphones, particularly the PZM (Push-to-Talk Microphone) and the close talking mikes. It was mentioned that the recognizer needed to be adapted to the close talking mikes, and there were concerns about the quality of the data collected. The speaker forms and consent forms were also discussed, emphasizing the importance of having a clear understanding of the data being collected and the need for proper documentation. The team was encouraged to explore the use of PZMs for better results, and there was a general sentiment that the data could be improved with more adaptation and analysis. The conversation concluded with the idea of protecting the data from public access while ensuring that it is still usable for analysis. Overall, the microphone data was seen as a critical area for improvement and adaptation.

    "va-sq-258": "The professor mentioned that positional parameters are important for speech recognition and suggested that they could be used to improve the accuracy of the system. He noted that the decision about how strongly to train different features should be based on a reasonable criterion with hidden variables, and he emphasized the need for robustness in the system. He also indicated that the approach of using soft \"AND\" and \"OR\" logic could help in combining different features effectively. Overall, the professor seemed to view positional parameters as a crucial aspect of the research and a potential area for improvement in the system. However, he also acknowledged that the specific implementation details needed further exploration. (Note: The exact wording may vary based on the context and specific points made in the transcript.)
