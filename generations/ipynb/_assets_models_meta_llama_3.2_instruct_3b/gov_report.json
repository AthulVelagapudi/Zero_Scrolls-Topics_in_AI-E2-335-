    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States for certain types of torts committed by federal employees. The law was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries or damages caused by the negligence or wrongful conduct of federal employees. The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity from liability for certain types of torts, allowing individuals to bring civil lawsuits against the government for damages. The law applies to torts committed by federal employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment. The FTCA also provides a mechanism for the Attorney General to certify that a federal employee was acting within the scope of their employment, which can shield the employee from liability and allow the government to substitute itself as the defendant in the case. The law contains several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the intentional tort exception, and the law enforcement proviso. These exceptions limit the types of torts that can be brought against the United States under the FTCA. The FTCA has been the subject of controversy and criticism, with some arguing that it has led to an increase in frivolous lawsuits and others arguing that it has provided an important means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by government negligence. Overall, the FTCA remains an important tool for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by federal employees, but its limitations and exceptions must be carefully considered in any lawsuit brought under the law.",

As a result, EM\u2019s internal tracking of milestones has inconsistencies, and the program has not consistently reported required information to Congress. The report also found that EM does not track the original baseline schedule for renegotiated milestone dates, which limits its ability to use milestones for managing and measuring the performance of its cleanup program.\n\nThe report makes four recommendations to the DOE: (1) update EM\u2019s policies and procedures to establish a standard definition of milestones and specify requirements for including and updating information on milestones across the complex; (2) track original milestone dates as well as changes to cleanup milestones; (3) comply with the requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act by reporting annually to Congress on the status of its cleanup milestones and including a complete list of cleanup milestones for all sites required by the act; and (4) conduct root cause analyses of missed or postponed milestones.\n\nThe report also notes that the lack of standardization in defining and tracking milestones, inadequate reporting to Congress, and failure to conduct root cause analyses of missed or postponed milestones limit EM\u2019s ability to manage its mission and oversee the cleanup work.

The system was initially planned to be implemented in 2005, but its development was delayed several times due to technical challenges and cost overruns. The system was finally deployed in 2018, and it has been used by CBP and partner agencies to process imports and exports.\n\nThe ACE system has several stages, including pre-arrival, arrival/cargo release, and post-release. The pre-arrival stage involves the submission of paperwork and electronic information by importers and shipping companies. The arrival/cargo release stage involves the review of documents and the examination of goods for import security and trade enforcement purposes. The post-release stage involves the filing of additional entry summary documents and the verification of importers' cargo classifications and calculation of customs duties, taxes, and fees owed.\n\nThe ACE system has been used by CBP and partner agencies to improve the efficiency and accuracy of import processing. The system has reduced the time required for processing imports, eliminated the need for paper forms, and improved the accuracy of customs data. The system has also improved the ability of CBP and partner agencies to identify and examine high-risk imports for inspection.\n\nThe ACE system has been used by several partner agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).

    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a program called the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) that transfers excess controlled property to law enforcement agencies. The program is administered by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The report highlights the benefits of the LESO program, including the transfer of property to enhance counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. The program also supports other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue, natural disaster response, and police training.\n\nThe report also highlights the weaknesses in the LESO program, including the lack of adequate internal controls for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk. The program has not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, and the lack of adequate controls has allowed for the transfer of property to unauthorized individuals.\n\nThe report makes four recommendations to the DOD to address the weaknesses in the LESO program. The recommendations include reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials transfer controlled property to authorized individuals, issuing guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe report concludes that the DOD has taken some steps to address the weaknesses in the LESO program, but more work is needed to strengthen the program and prevent fraud. The report highlights the importance of the LESO program in supporting law enforcement agencies and the need for the DOD to take a proactive approach to addressing the weaknesses in the program.",
