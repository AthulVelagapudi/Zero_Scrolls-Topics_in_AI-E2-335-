    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that there is a trend of filling only 65% of the priority places for teacher training in Welsh teacher training centers. He attributed this to a decline in the number of students applying for teacher training, particularly for secondary school teachers. He mentioned that the decline is not unique to Wales, as similar trends are seen in other countries, including the USA, Australia, and Finland. He also mentioned that the decline is not just due to financial incentives, but also due to other factors such as the lack of confidence in teaching as a profession. To address this issue, Kirsty Williams mentioned that the Welsh Government is taking steps such as making sure that the ITE provision is world-class, providing financial incentives, and embarking on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. He also mentioned that the Government is working on a new part-time PGCE route that will allow students to combine their employment opportunities with studying to become a teacher.
