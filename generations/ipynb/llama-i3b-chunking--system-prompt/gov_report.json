The basin's water storage and conveyance facilities, including dams, reservoirs, and canals, play a vital role in managing the river's flow and ensuring the delivery of water to downstream users. However, the basin's water resources are facing significant challenges, including drought, climate change, and population growth.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework for managing the river's water resources among the seven basin states and Mexico. The compact apportioned the river's water among the states and Mexico, with the Upper Basin states providing water to the Lower Basin states and Mexico. The compact also established a system of storage and conveyance facilities to manage the river's flow and ensure the delivery of water to downstream users.\n\nIn recent years, the basin has faced significant drought and water shortages, which have led to increased competition for water resources and calls for new water storage and conveyance projects. The 2007 Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead were developed to address these issues and provide a framework for managing the river's water resources during drought.\n\nIn 2019, the Colorado River Basin states and Mexico finalized drought contingency plans to address the ongoing drought and ensure the delivery of water to downstream users. The plans include measures to reduce water use, increase water storage, and improve the efficiency of water delivery systems.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin is also home to a diverse range of ecosystems and species, including several federally endangered species. The basin's water resources are being managed to protect and restore these ecosystems and species, including the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program.\n\nOverall, the Colorado River Basin is a critical water resource that requires careful management to ensure the delivery of water to downstream users and protect the basin's ecosystems and species. The basin's water resources are facing significant challenges, including drought, climate change, and population growth, and new water storage and conveyance projects are needed to address these challenges and ensure the long-term sustainability of the basin's water resources.\n\nRecommendations:\nBased on the report, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1. Increase funding for water storage and conveyance projects in the Colorado River Basin to address the ongoing drought and ensure the delivery of water to downstream users.\n2.

For example, GSA's design choices have included interior natural light, durable and easily maintained materials and finishes, and low-maintenance landscaping, which have reduced O&M costs. However, GSA's design choices have also included multistory atriums and custom windows, which have increased O&M costs.\n\nThe review also found that GSA's design choices have affected building functionality, with some design choices improving functionality and others not. For example, GSA's design choices have included energy-efficient lighting and heating systems, which have improved functionality, but have also included design choices that have increased energy costs.\n\nThe review recommends that GSA update its procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process for new Design Excellence buildings. The review also recommends that GSA update its procedures to require GSA officials to obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing the O&M consequences of design choices at key decision points during the planning and design of new Design Excellence buildings. Additionally, the review recommends that GSA update its procedures to require GSA officials to further consider and document how design choices may affect building functionality, such as whether a building is publicly visible and accessible. Finally, the review recommends that GSA update its procedures to require GSA officials to systematically collect and share information with project teams responsible for overseeing the planning and design of new buildings on the positive and negative effects of common design choices on O&M costs in existing Design Excellence buildings.",
