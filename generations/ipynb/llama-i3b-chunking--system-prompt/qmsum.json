    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components focused on the choice of materials for the remote control. The team considered titanium, rubber, and plastic as options. Titanium was initially preferred due to its strength and durability, but it was ultimately rejected due to its high cost and difficulty in manufacturing. Rubber was also considered, but its high cost and potential for being too soft or fragile made it an unappealing option. Plastic was seen as a more feasible alternative, but its durability and ability to withstand various environments were still concerns. The team decided to explore the use of titanium panels with a rubber body, which would provide a balance between strength, durability, and cost. The discussion also touched on the use of batteries, with the team opting for simple batteries instead of solar cells due to their reliability and cost-effectiveness. The choice of materials and components was influenced by the team's desire to create a remote control that is both functional and fashionable, with a focus on following current trends and consumer preferences.",

The sector needs to take responsibility for managing their own risk appetite, and the HEFCW can provide guidance and support. The key is to have a clear understanding of what constitutes risk and what is acceptable, and to have a robust governance framework in place to ensure that institutions are making informed decisions. The HEFCW can provide a toolkit to help governing bodies make better decisions, but ultimately, it's up to the institutions to take ownership of their risk management. The HEFCW's role is to provide an external perspective and to challenge institutions to think again about their aspirations, but it's not about second-guessing everything. The goal is to have a consistent minimum set of expectations for institutions, so that they can make informed decisions about their own risk management.",

    "va-sq-219": "The target price of the remote control is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. However, the project manager mentions that the finance people estimate that they need production costs of a maximum of \u20ac12.5 to reach a profit target. This implies that the target profit is the difference between the target price and the target cost. Since the target cost is not mentioned, we can only assume that it is lower than \u20ac12.5. The target profit is therefore at least \u20ac12.5 - \u20ac12.5 = \u20ac0, which is not a meaningful target profit. The target price is likely to be higher than the target cost, but the exact amount is not specified. \n\nNote: The transcript does not provide enough information to determine the target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control. The information provided is only about the overall budget and the need for a high battery life. \n\nHowever, based on the discussion, it can be inferred that the target price is likely to be higher than the target cost, and the target profit is likely to be a small margin, possibly in the range of 10-20%. \n\nFor example, if the target cost is \u20ac12.5, a target profit of 15% would be \u20ac1.875, and a target price of \u20ac14.375 would be a reasonable estimate. However, this is only a rough estimate and the actual target price, target cost and target profit may be different. \n\nIn any case, the transcript does not provide enough information to determine the exact target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control. \n\nThe user interface designer mentions that the remote control should be \"trendy, user-friendly and original\". This suggests that the target price may be higher than the target cost, and the target profit may be a small margin. However, this is only a rough estimate and the actual target price, target cost and target profit may be different. \n\nIn summary, the transcript does not provide enough information to determine the target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control. However, based on the discussion, it can be inferred that the target price is likely to be higher than the target cost, and the target profit is likely to be a small margin. \n\nNote: The answer is based on a rough estimate and the actual target price, target cost and target profit may be different. \n\nThe final answer is: There is not enough information in the transcript to determine the target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control.
