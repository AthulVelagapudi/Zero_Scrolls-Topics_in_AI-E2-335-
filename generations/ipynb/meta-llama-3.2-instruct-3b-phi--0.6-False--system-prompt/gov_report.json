The IDFC is a successor to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and will consolidate OPIC's functions, including its development finance activities. The IDFC's mission is to promote private investment in support of U.S. global development goals and foreign policy interests.\n\nThe IDFC's authorities will expand beyond OPIC's existing authorities to make loans and guarantees, issue insurance or reinsurance, and take minority equity positions in investments. The agency will prioritize support for less-developed countries and will consider the impact of its support on women's economic opportunities and outcomes.\n\nThe IDFC will be managed by a Board of Directors, which will include four U.S. government officials and four non-governmental members appointed by the President. The Board will have a Chief Development Officer, a Chief Risk Officer, and a Chief Executive Officer, who will be responsible for the agency's management and operations.\n\nThe IDFC will have a performance measurement system to evaluate and monitor its projects and will be required to submit annual reports to Congress. The agency will also maintain a user-friendly, publicly available database with detailed project-level information.\n\nThe IDFC is expected to become operational in early 2019, and its activities will complement those of the Export-Import Bank and the Trade and Development Agency. The agency's implementation will be overseen by the 116th Congress, which will review the reorganization plan and consider policy issues related to the IDFC's capacity limits, authorities, and policy parameters.\n\nThe IDFC's creation is seen as a response to China's growing economic influence in developing countries, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The agency's aim is to provide a means to spread U.S. values on governance, transparency, and environmental and social safeguards, and to promote U.S. strategic interests.\n\nThe IDFC's implementation raises questions about its role in development finance and its potential impact on the global development landscape. The agency's creation has sparked debate about its potential to compete with, contain, or counter the BRI and Chinese world vision. The U.S. involvement in developing international rules for development finance is also a topic of discussion, and it is unclear whether China will participate in such efforts.",

The 1996 law provided block grant funding to states to administer cash assistance and work programs for needy families with children. The law also required states to implement TANF and accept their block grant funding by July 1, 1997.\n\nThe 1996 law made significant changes to the AFDC program, including the elimination of the two-parent family exemption and the prohibition on AFDC benefits for unwed minor mothers. The law also introduced the concept of \"work incentives\" to encourage recipients to work and become self-sufficient. The TANF block grant provided states with flexibility to design their own programs and services, but also imposed certain requirements, such as maintaining a minimum level of work participation and providing child care assistance.\n\nSince its enactment, TANF has undergone several reauthorizations and amendments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended TANF funding through FY1999 and introduced the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) grant program. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 extended TANF funding through FY2010 and introduced competitive grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended TANF funding through FY2010 and provided additional funding for child care and other services.\n\nIn 2011, the TANF block grant was extended through September 30, 2011, and again in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. In 2017, the TANF block grant was extended through May 5, 2017, and again in 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 extended TANF funding through December 7, 2018.

The Bureau of Reclamation, a part of the Department of the Interior, plays a crucial role in managing the basin's waters. The federal government has a significant influence on the management of the Colorado River due to its ownership and operation of multiple storage and conveyance facilities, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users.\n\nThe Colorado River is used for various purposes, including municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses, with a majority of water supplies going to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land. The river also provides water supplies to nearly 40 million people. The basin's water storage projects can store up to 60 million acre-feet, or about four times the river's annual flows. The two largest dams, Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam, are operated to regulate flows and generate electricity.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework for apportioning water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the dividing line at Lee Ferry, Arizona. The compact was ratified by all states except Arizona, which later ratified it in 1936. The compact also established the Upper Colorado River Commission to coordinate operations among Upper Basin states.\n\nSince 2000, the basin has experienced significant drought, with natural flows averaging 12.4 million acre-feet annually, compared to the long-term average of 14.8 million acre-feet. The drought has caused a structural deficit, where Lower Basin inflows exceed mandatory releases to Mexico and other downstream users. To address this, Congress has authorized several drought contingency plans, including the Upper Basin and Lower Basin DCPs, which require states to curtail use and contribute to Lake Mead storage.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin faces several environmental challenges, including salinity control, endangered species conservation, and habitat restoration. Reclamation has implemented various programs to mitigate these effects, including the Upper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program, the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program, and the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program.\n\nCongress plays a crucial role in managing the Colorado River Basin, providing funding and oversight of existing facilities and programs. The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for operating and maintaining the basin's water storage projects and ensuring compliance with federal laws and regulations.

    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the United States' sovereign immunity from certain types of tort claims, allowing plaintiffs to sue the government for damages in federal court. The FTCA was enacted in 1946 to provide a mechanism for victims of government wrongdoing to seek compensation and to deter future tortious conduct by federal employees. The Act applies to torts committed by federal employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment, but excludes claims arising from the exercise of discretion or policy judgment.\n\nThe FTCA has several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the law enforcement proviso, the foreign country exception, and the Feres doctrine. The discretionary function exception bars claims arising from conduct that involves the exercise of judgment or choice, while the law enforcement proviso waives immunity for certain intentional torts committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. The foreign country exception preserves the government's immunity for claims arising from activities conducted in foreign countries. The Feres doctrine shields the government from liability for injuries to servicemen arising from activities incident to military service.\n\nThe FTCA also imposes procedural requirements, including a statute of limitations and exhaustion provisions, which limit when a plaintiff may file a tort lawsuit against the United States. The Act requires plaintiffs to submit their claims to the relevant federal agency and to specify the maximum amount of damages they seek. If the agency denies the claim, the plaintiff may file a lawsuit in federal court within six months of the agency's denial.\n\nThere have been proposals to amend the FTCA, including modifying the Feres doctrine to allow servicemembers to sue the government for certain injuries arising from medical malpractice. Private bills have also been introduced to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the government under the FTCA. The FTCA continues to play an important role in providing a mechanism for victims of government wrongdoing to seek compensation and to deter future tortious conduct by federal employees.",

These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers. Most of these programs have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program requires a federal disaster designation.\n\nThe federal crop insurance program, also known as the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), protects crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, plant diseases, and declines in commodity prices. The program is available for most crops, including corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay, and provides coverage for crop yield and price declines. The premium for this portion of coverage is completely subsidized by the federal government.\n\nThe NAP program provides financial assistance to producers who grow crops that are not eligible for federal crop insurance. This program is not subject to annual appropriations and receives mandatory funding. To be eligible for a NAP payment, a producer must experience at least a 50% crop loss caused by a natural disaster or be prevented from planting more than 35% of intended crop acreage.\n\nThe Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths due to eligible loss conditions such as extreme weather, disease, or animal attacks. The program also provides assistance for livestock that are injured as a result of an eligible loss condition but do not die and are sold at a reduced price.\n\nThe Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions. ELAP specifically provides assistance for the loss of honey bee colonies in excess of normal mortality.\n\nThe Tree Assistance Program (TAP) makes payments to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters. The program is available for trees grown for commercial sale, such as fruit, nut, and Christmas trees.\n\nThe Emergency Disaster Loans program provides low-interest loans to agricultural producers in disaster-affected areas to help them recover from production losses or physical losses. The program is administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and can be used for a variety of purposes, including repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment.\n\nIn addition to these programs,",

The report also discusses the process for identifying work search overpayments in state benefit accuracy measurement audits.\n\nThe report notes that overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements are the leading cause of improper payments in the UI program. In fiscal year 2017, states made an estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. The report also highlights the importance of verifying work search activities, as investigating claimant-reported job contacts is associated with lower work search overpayment rates.\n\nThe report identifies several factors that are associated with work search overpayment rates, including the minimum number of work search activities required per week, the type of required employer, and the frequency and method of reporting. States with more cases with claimants who were required to search for work had higher work search overpayment rates, while states with more cases for which BAM auditors investigated job contacts had lower work search overpayment rates.\n\nThe report also discusses the use of formal warnings by states to address work search overpayments. States that issued formal warnings frequently had lower work search overpayment rates, but states that did not issue formal warnings had higher rates.

However, a review of these buildings found that GSA's design choices have resulted in both decreased and increased operational and maintenance (O&M) costs.\n\nOn the one hand, GSA has made design choices that have reduced O&M costs, such as incorporating natural light, using durable and easily maintained materials, and designing buildings with energy-efficient systems. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles features a light well and serrated glass fa\u00e7ade that maximizes natural light, reducing energy usage and the need for frequent lighting replacements. Similarly, the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, has lobby walls and floors made of durable travertine stone, which has lasted over 15 years without needing repairs.\n\nOn the other hand, some design choices have increased O&M costs, such as multistory atriums and lobbies, custom windows, and mission spaces. For instance, building managers reported that multistory atriums and lobbies have increased O&M costs due to the challenges associated with heating and cooling, making repairs, and cleaning these spaces. Additionally, the use of solar panels and green roofs has led to water leaks and problems maintaining unique landscaping.\n\nGSA's design choices have also affected building functionality, with some design choices having a positive impact on building functionality, such as the use of windows and atriums to allow natural light. However, other design choices, such as multistory atriums and lobbies, have not had a positive impact on building functionality.\n\nThe review found that GSA does not fully consider O&M and functionality effects when making design choices, and does not systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. GSA's current procedures do not require estimating or gathering information on O&M costs during the planning and design process, and the agency does not have a systematic process for sharing information on O&M costs with project teams responsible for managing new buildings.\n\nTo address these issues, the report recommends that the Administrator of the General Services Administration update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences of design choices, consider the impact of design choices on building functionality, and systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The report highlights the various uses and benefits of the Department of Defense's (DOD) excess controlled property (LESO) program for law enforcement agencies. The program allows federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to acquire excess DOD property, such as vehicles, equipment, and supplies, at no cost or at a significantly reduced cost. This report summarizes the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation into the LESO program.\n\nThe GAO found that law enforcement agencies have benefited from the program, including enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. The program has also been used for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, and serving warrants.\n\nHowever, the GAO identified weaknesses in the program's internal controls, including a lack of verification and approval processes for federal agency applications and enrollment. The investigation found that DLA's reliance on electronic communications without actual verification did not prevent the approval of a fraudulent application to obtain excess controlled property.\n\nThe GAO also identified weaknesses in the transfer of controlled property, including a lack of verification of identification and quantity of approved items prior to transfer. The investigation found that DLA personnel did not routinely request or check for valid identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and that the program lacked a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nThe GAO made four recommendations to DLA to address these weaknesses, including reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with DOD guidance for transferring controlled property, issuing guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe DOD concurred with all of the GAO's recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. The report concludes that conducting a fraud risk assessment could have program-wide improvements, including strengthening the controls to verify the legitimacy of applicants.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a committee established in 1975 to monitor the impact of foreign investment in the US and coordinate US policy on foreign investment. CFIUS reviews transactions involving foreign persons to determine if they pose a threat to national security. The committee is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes representatives from various government agencies.\n\nThe committee's primary function is to review transactions that have been submitted to it by parties involved in the transaction. These transactions can include mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers of US businesses by foreign persons. CFIUS reviews these transactions to determine if they pose a national security risk and whether they should be allowed to proceed.\n\nThe committee's review process involves several stages, including pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. During the review process, CFIUS considers various factors, including the potential national security-related effects of the transaction, the potential control of a US business by a foreign government, and the potential for the transaction to result in the transfer of sensitive technologies or information.\n\nCFIUS has experienced an increase in workload in recent years, with the number of transactions reviewed increasing from 111 in 2011 to 172 in 2016, a 55% increase. The committee has also seen an increase in the complexity of the transactions it reviews, with many involving new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nDespite the increase in workload, CFIUS has been able to review all transactions that have been voluntarily notified to it. However, some member agencies have expressed concerns that they are limited in their ability to complete other CFIUS functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures.\n\nThe committee's workload is expected to continue to increase, with some stakeholders expressing concerns that it may be difficult for CFIUS to complete its core functions if the workload continues to grow. To address these concerns, the Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, should coordinate member agency efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload.\n\nThe committee's review process is guided by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 1988, which requires CFIUS to consider various factors when reviewing transactions, including the potential national security-related effects of the transaction, the potential control of a US business by a foreign government, and the potential for the transaction to result in the transfer of sensitive technologies or information.\n\nOverall, CFIUS plays an important role",

It emphasizes the importance of collaboration and coordination among agencies and implementing partners to effectively reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife and combat wildlife trafficking.",
    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The US civil aviation industry is comprised of two main sectors: general aviation and commercial aviation. General aviation includes all aviation activities other than military and commercial airlines, and is where most civilian pilot students undergo their initial training. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates the safety of civil aviation in the US, including pilot certification and safety oversight of pilot training.\n\nThere are three main types of pilot schools: collegiate aviation schools, non-collegiate vocational pilot schools, and non-collegiate instructor-based pilot schools. Collegiate aviation schools offer a 2- or 4-year undergraduate degree in an aviation-based major, along with the necessary pilot certificates and ratings. Non-collegiate vocational pilot schools do not offer degree programs, but provide flight training and certification. Non-collegiate instructor-based pilot schools offer flexible training environments and allow students to complete their training in a shorter amount of time.\n\nTo become a commercial pilot, students must undergo initial training in general aviation and then receive additional training from their employer. The FAA requires pilot schools to meet specific standards, including training equipment, facilities, student records, and curriculum. Schools must also meet FAA regulations and undergo regular inspections to ensure compliance.\n\nThe cost of flight training is a significant challenge for many students, with total costs ranging from $50,000 to over $100,000. Federal student aid and scholarships are available, but many students still struggle to afford the cost of training. The FAA has implemented new regulations to address the shortage of pilots, including requiring more flight hours for first officers and increasing the minimum number of hours required for commercial pilots.\n\nCollegiate aviation schools face challenges in recruiting and retaining flight instructors, with many schools struggling to find qualified instructors to train students. The FAA has implemented new regulations to address this issue, including requiring flight instructors to have more experience before they can train other pilots. Some schools have implemented programs to retain flight instructors, such as offering bonuses and tuition reimbursement.\n\nThe industry is experiencing a shortage of pilots, with many airlines struggling to find qualified candidates. The FAA has implemented new regulations to address this issue, including increasing the minimum number of hours required for commercial pilots and requiring more flight hours for first officers. The industry is also experiencing an increase in pilot retirements, which is further exacerbating the shortage.\n\nThe US Department of Education and the Department of Veterans Affairs are also facing challenges in providing financial aid and support for students pursuing a career in aviation. The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented new regulations to address the issue of veterans' education benefits, but more needs to be done"
