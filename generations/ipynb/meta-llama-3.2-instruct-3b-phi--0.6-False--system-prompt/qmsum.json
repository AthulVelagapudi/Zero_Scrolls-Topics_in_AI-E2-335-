    "va-sq-184": "The government's plan towards structural change in the higher education sector in Wales, as mentioned by Dr. David Blaney, is to encourage institutions to think about structural change as a solution to the financial challenges they are facing. However, he emphasizes that this is not a policy position and that it's not always a good short-term response to crisis. Instead, he suggests that the sector's priority should be to manage the challenges they are facing, and that structural change should be considered as a long-term solution. He also mentions that the HEFCW's role is to support institutions in grappling with their problems before they become a crisis, and that they have a toolkit to help governing bodies make informed decisions.",
    "va-sq-186": "The solution to risk appetite is not explicitly stated as a specific answer, but rather, Dr David Blaney mentions that the sector is not seeing an institution \"falling over\" and that the challenges are being managed. However, he also mentions that the direction of travel is that the financial pressures are increasing and that the efforts to secure the Diamond settlement and other funding are important to mitigate this. He also mentions that the sector is trying to take out costs to reduce financial stress, but notes that this may lead to a reduction in the range of curriculum, research, and innovation. \n\nIt is also mentioned that the governing bodies are being encouraged to engage in a process of independent review of governance in Wales, and that the HEFCW is supporting this process. However, it is not clear what specific steps are being taken to address risk appetite.",
    "va-sq-216": "The Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should have a simple and minimalistic design, with a focus on functionality rather than aesthetics. He mentioned that the design should be \"robust\" and \"easy to use\", and that it should be small enough to be held in one's hand. He also suggested that the design should be adaptable to different user preferences, such as having a \"previous\" button to go back to a previous channel or action. However, he also mentioned that the design should not be too complex, and that they should avoid having too many buttons or features. Overall, the Industrial Designer seemed to prioritize functionality and usability over visual appeal.",
    "va-sq-219": "The target price, target cost, and target profit of the remote control are not explicitly stated in the given transcript.
