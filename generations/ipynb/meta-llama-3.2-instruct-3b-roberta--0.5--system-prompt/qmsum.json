    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components in the meeting centered around the selection of materials and design for a remote control. The Industrial Designer suggested using titanium for the body, citing its strength and durability. However, the Project Manager expressed concerns about the cost and difficulty in manufacturing. The Industrial Designer proposed using rubber for the buttons, but the Project Manager was concerned about the molding process. The group eventually decided to use a combination of titanium and rubber, with the titanium providing the body and rubber for the buttons. The discussion also touched on the use of advanced technology, such as speech recognition, and the importance of making the remote control easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. The Project Manager emphasized the need for a balance between functionality and design, and the group agreed to explore different options and consider the latest trends in design and technology.",

    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that the current year's intake of teachers for Welsh teacher training centers is 65% filled, which is below the target. She attributed this to the fact that the recruitment process takes a couple of months, and the targets are not yet met. However, she assured that they are making ITE (Institutional Training Education) provision \"world-class\" and have been working on financial incentives to attract more students to become teachers. She also mentioned that they are looking at the issue of teacher recruitment and retention, particularly in priority subjects and areas with a high need for teachers.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Minister, seems to be concerned about the pay dispute in the FE sector, particularly in relation to the lowest-paid non-teaching staff. She mentions that the situation is a \"consequential issue\" and that the Welsh Government is not currently able to support the sector financially. However, she does express a desire to see a resolution to the dispute and is open to discussions with ColegauCymru, the umbrella body for FE colleges in Wales, to find a solution. She also notes that the issue is not just about pay, but also about the integrity of the education system and the need to prevent \"cheating\" and ensure academic standards are maintained.",
