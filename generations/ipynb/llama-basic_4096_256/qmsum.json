    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer disagreed with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control because the User Interface suggested a rounded, ovoid shape, while the Industrial Designer preferred a more traditional, non-remote-like design.",
    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components in the meeting transcript revolves around the design of a new remote control. The team considers two main industrial components: titanium and rubber. They explore the possibility of using titanium, which is considered fancy and innovative, but also expensive. On the other hand, rubber is seen as a more feasible option, but it may not be as desirable. The team also discusses the importance of user-friendliness and the need for a simple and intuitive design. They consider using a combination of both materials, such as a titanium exterior with a rubber interior, to achieve a balance between innovation and practicality. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between different industrial components and the need to prioritize user needs and trends in the design process.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that trends are quite the same in many areas, and that the current trend is for remote controls to have a fancy look and feel, with a focus on being innovative and novel. They also learned that people are more interested in having a remote control that is fancy and has interesting features, rather than one that is easy to use. Additionally, they learned that people tend to change their remote controls more often than their batteries, and that the trend is moving faster than the life of the remote control itself.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion about appearance design focused on the trend of making remote controls more visually appealing and user-friendly. The team considered two main options: making the remote control look like a fruit (e.g. banana) or having a spongy, rubber-like appearance. They also discussed the importance of having a simple and easy-to-use interface, with a limited number of buttons, and sticking to classical design elements such as two batteries. The team decided to explore both options and consider using titanium or rubber materials, with the possibility of using paint to achieve the desired appearance. The goal is to create a remote control that is both functional and visually appealing, following current trends in design.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a final detailed design meeting for a product. The team discussed the prototype presentation, the evaluation criteria, and the finance. They decided to keep the features of the product, including voice recognition, LCD display, and a remote control, but removed the locator feature due to budget constraints. The team evaluated the project and found it to be productive, with some difficulties with time pressure. The meeting was efficient and the team was satisfied with the outcome. The project is now complete and the team will complete a final questionnaire and meeting summary.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer, which provides 30 hours of free childcare for eligible 3- to 4-year-olds. The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, and officials from the Welsh Government attended the meeting. The committee raised several questions and concerns about the offer, including its impact on child development, the potential for exacerbating disadvantage, and the integration with the UK Government's tax-free childcare offer. The Minister and officials responded to the questions, providing information on the offer's design, its expected impact, and the measures being taken to promote awareness and accessibility. The committee also discussed the quality of childcare, the integration with the UK Government's offer, and the potential for parents to access both offers. The meeting concluded with the committee resolving to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that the trend of teacher recruiting is a concern, but she didn't elaborate on the specific reasons for it. However, she mentioned that the issue is related to the pay disparity between schoolteachers and FE teachers, and that the Welsh Government is exploring ways to address this issue. She also mentioned that the Welsh HE sector has a high-quality system, and she wants to maintain its integrity.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that the Welsh Government is keeping a close eye on the pay dispute situation in the Further Education (FE) sector, but she did not take a proactive role in resolving the dispute. She acknowledged that the reason for the dispute is partly due to the pay settlement for schoolteachers, and that the Welsh Government does not have the funds to support a pay award for FE staff. She emphasized that the situation is up to ColegauCymru to negotiate with the trade unions, and that the Welsh Government will wait to see the outcome of those negotiations before responding formally.",

    "va-sq-145": "The product manager wants to achieve the expected profit by making the remote control trendy and original, and by using a universal design that fits different types of televisions and D-VHS players. They also want to make the remote control easy to use and have a user-friendly interface. Additionally, they want to make the remote control available in different colors, such as black, silver, and pink, to appeal to different customers.",
    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed various aspects of speech recognition and noise reduction. The team talked about the challenges of the TORRENT chip project, which was two years behind schedule. They also discussed different noise reduction techniques, including spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and VTS (Vector Quantization of Speech). The team considered applying VTS in the cepstral domain and normalizing the speech signal before and after VTS. They also discussed the pros and cons of different methods and the potential for combining them. Additionally, they talked about the need to estimate the noise with the first frames before applying VAD (Voice Activity Detection) and on-line normalization. The meeting also touched on the idea of using a combination of different techniques to improve the performance of the system.",
