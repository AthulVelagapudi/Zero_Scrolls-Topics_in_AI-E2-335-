    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was established by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The law provided funding for TANF through FY2002 and established a block grant program that gave states significant flexibility in designing and implementing their programs. The law also introduced the concept of \"work requirements\" for TANF recipients, which aimed to encourage work and self-sufficiency among low-income families.\n\nThe TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act raised the cap on education as work from 20% to 30% and introduced the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) grant program. The WTW program provided funding for states to implement job training and employment services for TANF recipients. In 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act eliminated the WTW program and introduced competitive grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives.\n\nIn 2011, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act extended TANF funding through September 30, 2012, and prohibited electronic benefit transactions at liquor stores, casinos, and strip clubs. The Protect Our Kids Act of 2012 appropriated $612 million to the TANF contingency fund and reserved $2 million for a commission to examine child welfare fatalities.\n\nIn 2017, the Consolidated Appropriation Act extended TANF funding for the remainder of FY2017 and through the end of FY2018, and introduced a database to track research projects that deliver services to move TANF recipients into work. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019, ending a funding gap that occurred after the expiration of the previous law.\n\nToday, TANF is a block grant program that provides funding to states to support low-income families with children. The program has undergone significant changes since its inception, with a focus on promoting work and self-sufficiency among TANF recipients. However, the program continues to face challenges, including the need to balance work requirements with the need to support vulnerable populations.",

    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States government for certain torts, or wrongful acts, committed by federal employees or officers. The law serves two main purposes: to deter people from committing torts and to compensate those who are injured by such acts.\n\nThe FTCA applies to a wide range of situations, including medical malpractice, car accidents, and property damage. However, the law has several limitations and exceptions. For example, the government is not liable for injuries that occur during military service, except in certain circumstances. Additionally, the government is not liable for punitive damages or prejudgment interest.\n\nTo bring a claim under the FTCA, an individual must first file a written notification with the relevant federal agency, which must then deny the claim. If the agency denies the claim, the individual can then file a lawsuit in federal court within six months. The FTCA also has a statute of limitations, which is two years from the date of the injury.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of several legislative proposals to amend or modify its provisions. One such proposal is to abrogate or narrow the Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for injuries to servicemen that arise out of or are in the course of military service. Another proposal is to expand the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity to include certain categories of claims or plaintiffs.\n\nIn addition to legislative proposals, Congress has the authority to enact private bills to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.",

The first type provides drinking water that has been treated by DOD, while the second type provides water treated by a private company or local utility.\n\n**Findings**\n\nOur review of DOD's data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations found that DOD public water systems complied with EPA and state regulations at a level comparable to other systems in the United States. However, we found that the military departments did not report all violations of these regulations to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD(EI&E)). This suggests that DOD's internal reporting requirements for drinking water data are unclear or not well understood.\n\nWe also found that DOD systems providing treated drinking water had more reported health-based violations than systems providing non-DOD-treated drinking water. However, DOD has not used these data to identify the reasons for these differences and has not taken action to address them.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nWe recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, identify and implement any necessary changes to DOD's environmental compliance policy to clarify DOD's reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations.\n\nWe also recommend that the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force identify and implement actions to increase understanding at their respective installations and commands about DOD's reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations.\n\nFinally, we recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment review reported compliance data to identify the reasons for any differences in the number of violations of health-based drinking water regulations between DOD's two types of public water systems and take action to address the causes of any differences.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur review of DOD's drinking water systems found that while DOD's systems complied with health-based drinking water regulations at a level comparable to other systems in the United States, there were gaps in DOD's internal reporting and a lack of understanding of the reasons for differences in violations between DOD's two types of public water systems.

The GSA's Design Excellence Program, established in 1994, aims to create unique and aesthetically pleasing workspaces while meeting the functional needs of tenant agencies. However, a review of 78 federal buildings constructed under the program found that GSA does not systematically consider operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and functionality in its design process.\n\nThe review found that GSA's current procedures do not require the agency to estimate O&M costs for design choices, and the agency does not gather information on the effects of design choices on O&M costs in existing buildings. This lack of consideration can lead to costly design features that increase O&M costs and may not be necessary for the building's intended purpose.\n\nThe review also found that GSA's efforts to consider O&M costs in the design process are inconsistent with pertinent standards for internal control in the federal government. The agency's process for collecting and sharing information on O&M costs is also inadequate, as it does not provide a clear picture of the ongoing costs of design choices.\n\nThe review recommends that the Administrator of the General Services Administration update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate O&M costs for design choices, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and consider the effects of design choices on building functionality. The agency should also systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.\n\nThe review's findings and recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of GSA's procedures, policies, and standards for designing, constructing, and operating federal facilities, as well as data from 78 federal buildings constructed under the Design Excellence Program.

The program has been used for various law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security efforts. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the program has several weaknesses in its processes for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk.\n\nThe GAO report found that DOD's internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency applications were inadequate, as DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and did not conduct site visits to verify the legitimacy of applications. The report also found that DLA's internal controls for transferring property were weak, as personnel did not verify the quantity of approved items before transfer, and did not maintain accurate accountability records.\n\nThe GAO report also found that DLA lacked a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures, and had not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program. The report made four recommendations to DOD to address these weaknesses, including revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with transfer procedures, issuing guidance on verifying the type and quantity of approved items, and conducting a fraud risk assessment.\n\nThe DOD concurred with the GAO's recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. The LESO program has been used by various law enforcement agencies to acquire property, including vehicles, equipment, and other items, which have been used for various law enforcement activities.

The strategy identifies reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife as a top priority, with a focus on raising public awareness and changing consumption patterns.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* The demand for illegal wildlife products is a significant problem, with an estimated annual value of $7 billion.\n* Agencies are taking steps to reduce demand, including building law enforcement capacity, raising awareness, and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.\n* However, there is a need for greater coordination and clarity on roles and responsibilities among agencies, which can lead to fragmented efforts and a lack of impact.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* The Secretary of the Interior, State, and USAID should work together to clarify roles and responsibilities of mission staff engaged in combating wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia.\n* Agencies should establish joint strategies, define a common outcome, and agree on roles and responsibilities to enhance and sustain collaborative efforts.\n* Agencies should prioritize evaluation and monitoring to assess the effectiveness of their CWT activities.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWildlife trafficking is a significant threat to protected and endangered species, and reducing demand for these products is crucial to combating this issue. By clarifying roles and responsibilities, establishing joint strategies, and prioritizing evaluation and monitoring, agencies can work more effectively to reduce demand and protect wildlife.",
    "gao_GAO-18-403": "**Summary of Report: Collegiate Aviation Schools and the Production of Professional Pilots**\n\nThe report highlights the challenges faced by collegiate aviation schools in producing professional pilots. The report found that these schools face various challenges, including limited resources, high costs, and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Background**\n\nCivil aviation in the United States can be broadly categorized into two sectors: general aviation and commercial aviation. Collegiate aviation schools offer professional pilot degree programs that prepare students for careers in commercial aviation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates the safety of civil aviation in the United States, including pilot certification and training.\n\n**Challenges Faced by Collegiate Aviation Schools**\n\nThe report identified several challenges faced by collegiate aviation schools, including:\n\n1. **Limited resources**: Many schools face financial constraints, which can limit their ability to provide high-quality training and equipment.\n2. **High costs**: The cost of purchasing and maintaining aircraft, as well as the cost of flight training, can be prohibitively expensive for some schools.\n3. **Regulatory requirements**: The FAA's regulatory requirements for pilot training and certification can be complex and time-consuming, placing a burden on schools.\n4. **Enrollment and retention**: Schools face challenges in recruiting and retaining students, particularly in the face of increasing competition from other aviation programs.\n5. **Veterans' education benefits**: The report found that some schools face challenges in providing flight training to veterans who are eligible for federal student financial aid and veterans' education benefits.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to address the challenges faced by collegiate aviation schools, including:\n\n1. **Increased funding**: The FAA and Congress should consider increasing funding for collegiate aviation schools to help them provide high-quality training and equipment.\n2. **Streamlined regulatory requirements**: The FAA should review and streamline its regulatory requirements to reduce the burden on schools and make it easier for them to provide training and certification.\n3. **Scholarships and financial aid**: Airlines and industry organizations should provide scholarships and financial aid to help students pursue careers in commercial aviation.\n4. **Veterans' education benefits**: The Department of Veterans Affairs should work with collegiate aviation schools to provide more flexible and accessible veterans' education benefits.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe report concludes that collegiate aviation schools face significant challenges in producing professional pilots. Addressing these challenges will require a coordinated effort from the FAA, Congress, airlines, and industry organizations. By working together, we can ensure that the United States has a sufficient supply of trained pilots to meet the needs of the aviation industry."
