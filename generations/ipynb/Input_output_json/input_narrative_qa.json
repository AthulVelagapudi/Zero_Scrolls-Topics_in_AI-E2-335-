This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n\nMary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but\nher nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then\nretired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw\nthe estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way\nto dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick,\nsupported the old, and educated the young.\n\nThese occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when all her\nformer woes would return and haunt her.--Whenever she did, or said, any\nthing she thought Henry would have approved of--she could not avoid\nthinking with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to\nher heart--a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and\nreligion could not fill. The latter taught her to struggle for\nresignation; and the former rendered life supportable.\n\nHer delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of\nsolitary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind--She thought\nshe was hastening to that world _where there is neither marrying_, nor\ngiving in marriage.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 16357-8.txt or 16357-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/6/3/5/16357\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

The elderly gentleman--his hair was quite\nwhite now--slowly shook his head, as he murmured again:\n\n\"It can't be done, Tom! It can't be done! I admit that you've made\na lot of wonderful things--things I never dreamed of--but this is\ntoo much. To transmit pictures over a telephone wire, so that\npersons cannot only see to whom they are talking, as well as hear\nthem--well, to be frank with you, Tom, I should be sorry to see\nyou waste your time trying to invent such a thing.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you. Not only do I think it can be done, but\nI'm going to do it. In fact, I've already started on it. As for\nwasting my time, well, I haven't anything in particular to do, now\nthat my giant cannon has been perfected, so I might as well be\nworking on my new photo telephone instead of sitting around idle.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom, I agree with you there,\" said Mr. Swift. \"Sitting\naround idle isn't good for anyone--man or boy, young or old. So\ndon't think I'm finding fault because you're busy.\"\n\n\"It's only that I don't want to see you throw away your efforts,\nonly to be disappointed in the end. It can't be done, Tom, it\ncan't be done,\" and the aged inventor shook his head in pitying\ndoubt.\n\nTom only smiled confidently, and went on:\n\n\"Well, Dad, all you'll have to do will be to wait and see. It\nisn't going to be easy--I grant that. In fact, I've run up against\nmore snags, the little way I've gone so far, than I like to admit.\nBut I'm going to stick at it, and before this year is out I'll\nguarantee, Father, that you can be at one end of the telephone\nwire, talking to me, at the other, and I'll see you and you'll see\nme--if not as plainly as we see each other now, at least plainly\nenough to make sure of each other.\"\n\nMr. Swift chuckled silently, gradually breaking into a louder\nlaugh. Instead of being angry, Tom only regarded his father with\nan indulgent smile, and continued:\n\n\"All right, Dad. Go ahead, laugh!\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, I'm not exactly laughing at YOU--it's more at the\nidea than anything else. The idea of talking over a wire and, at\nthe same time, having light waves, as well as electrical waves\npassing on the same conductor!\"\n\n\"All right, Dad, go ahead and laugh. I don't mind,\" said Tom,\ngood-naturedly. \"Folks laughed at Bell, when he said he could send\na human voice over a copper spring; but Bell went ahead and to-day\nwe can talk over a thousand miles by wire. That was the telephone.\"\n\n\"Folks laughed at Morse when he said he could send a message over\nthe wire. He let 'em laugh, but we have the telegraph. Folks\nlaughed at Edison, when he said he could take the human voice--or\nany other sound--and fix it on a wax cylinder or a hard-rubber\nplate--but he did it, and we have the phonograph. And folks\nlaughed at Santos Dumont, at the Wrights, and at all the other\nfellows, who said they could take a heavier-than-air machine, and\nskim above the clouds like a bird; but we do it--I've done it--you've\ndone it.\"\n\n\"Hold on, Tom!\" protested Mr. Swift. \"I give up! Don't rub it in\non your old dad. I admit that folks did laugh at those inventors,\nwith their seemingly impossible schemes, but they made good. And\nyou've made good lots of times where I thought you wouldn't. But\njust stop to consider for a moment. This thing of sending a\npicture over a telephone wire is totally out of the question, and\nentirely opposed to all the principles of science.\"\n\n\"What do I care for principles of science?\" cried Tom, and he\nstrode about the room so rapidly that Eradicate, the old colored\nservant, who came in with the mail, skipped out of the library\nwith the remark:\n\n\"Deed, an' Massa Tom must be pow'fully preragitated dis mawnin'!\"\n\n\"Some of the scientists said it was totally opposed to all natural\nlaws when I planned my electric rifle,\" went on Tom. \"But I made\nit, and it shot. They said my air glider would never stay up, but\nshe did.\"\n\n\"But, Tom, this is different. You are talking of sending light\nwaves--one of the most delicate forms of motion in the world--over\na material wire. It can't be done!\"\n\n\"Look here, Dad!\" exclaimed Tom, coming to a halt in front of his\nparent. \"What is light, anyhow? Merely another form of motion;\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, Tom, I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Tom. \"With vibrations of a certain length\nand rapidity we get sound--the faster the vibration per second the\nhigher the sound note. Now, then, we have sound waves, or\nvibrations, traveling at the rate of a mile in a little less than\nfive seconds; that is, with the air at a temperature of sixty\ndegrees. With each increase of a degree of temperature we get an\nincrease of about a foot per second in the rapidity with which\nsound travels.\"\n\n\"Now, then, light shoots along at the rate of 186,000,000 miles a\nsecond. That is more than many times around the earth in a second\nof time. So we have sound, one kind of wave motion, or energy; we\nhave light, a higher degree of vibration or wave motion, and then\nwe come to electricity--and nobody has ever yet exactly measured\nthe intensity or speed of the electric vibrations.\"\n\n\"But what I'm getting at is this--that electricity must travel\npretty nearly as fast as light--if not faster. So I believe that\nelectricity and light have about the same kind of vibrations, or\nwave motion.\"\n\n\"Now, then, if they do have--and I admit it's up to me to prove\nit,\" went on Tom, earnestly--\"why can't I send light-waves over a\nwire, as well as electrical waves?\"\n\nMr. Swift was silent for a moment. Then he said, slowly:\n\n\"Well, Tom, I never heard it argued just that way before. Maybe\nthere's something in your photo telephone after all. But it never\nhas been done. You can't deny that!\"\n\nHe looked at his son triumphantly. It was not because he wanted to\nget the better of him in argument, that Mr. Swift held to his own\nviews; but he wanted to bring out the best that was in his\noffspring. Tom accepted the challenge instantly.\n\n\"Yes, Dad, it has been done, in a way!\" he said, earnestly. \"No\none has sent a picture over a telephone wire, as far as I know,\nbut during the recent hydroplane tests at Monte Carlo, photographs\ntaken of some of the events in the morning, and afternoon, were\ndeveloped in the evening, and transmitted over five hundred miles\nof wire to Paris, and those same photographs were published in the\nParis newspapers the next morning.\"\n\n\"Is that right, Tom?\"\n\n\"It certainly is. The photographs weren't so very clear, but you\ncould make out what they were. Of course that is a different\nsystem than the one I'm thinking of. In that case they took a\nphotograph, and made a copper plate of it, as they would for a\nhalf-tone illustration. This gave them a picture with ridges and\ndepressions in copper, little hills and valleys, so to speak,\naccording to whether there were light or dark tints in the\npicture. The dark places meant that the copper lines stood up\nhigher there than where there were light colors.\"\n\n\"Now, by putting this copper plate on a wooden drum, and revolving\nthis drum, with an electrical needle pressing lightly on the\nridges of copper, they got a varying degree of electrical current.\nWhere the needle touched a high place in the copper plate the\ncontact was good, and there was a strong current. When the needle\ngot to a light place in the copper--a depression, so to speak--the\ncontact was not so good, and there was only a weak current.\"\n\n\"At the receiving end of the apparatus there was a sensitized film\nplaced on a similar wooden drum. This was to receive the image\nthat came over the five hundred miles of wire. Now then, as the\nelectrical needle, moving across the copper plate, made electrical\ncontacts of different degrees of strength, it worked a delicate\ngalvanometer on the receiving end. The galvanometer caused a beam\nof light to vary--to grow brighter or dimmer, according as the\nelectrical current was stronger or weaker. And this light, falling\non the sensitive plate, made a picture, just like the one on the\ncopper plate in Monte Carlo.\"\n\n\"In other words, where the copper plate was black, showing that\nconsiderable printing ink was needed, the negative on the other\nend was made light. Then when that negative was printed it would\ncome out black, because more light comes through the light places\non a photograph negative than through the dark places. And so,\nwith the galvanometer making light flashes on the sensitive plate,\nthe galvanometer being governed by the electrical contacts five\nhundred miles away, they transmitted a photograph by wire.\"\n\n\"But not a telephone wire, Tom.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any difference, Dad. It was a wire just the\nsame. But I'm not going into that just now, though later I may\nwant to send photographs by wire. What I'm aiming at is to make an\napparatus so that when you go into a telephone booth to talk to a\nfriend, you can see him and he can see you, on a specially\nprepared plate that will be attached to the telephone.\"\n\n\"You mean see him as in a looking-glass, Tom?\"\n\n\"Somewhat, yes. Though I shall probably use a metal plate instead\nof glass. It will be just as if you were talking over a telephone\nin an open field, where you could see the other party and he could\nsee you.\"\n\n\"But how are you going to do it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't quite decided. I shall probably have to use the\nmetal called selenium, which is very sensitive to light, and which\nmakes a good or a poor electrical conductor according as more or\nless light falls on it. After all, a photograph is only lights and\nshadows, fixed on sensitive paper or films.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't. I admit\nyou've used some good arguments,\" said Mr. Swift. \"But then, it\nall comes down to this: What good will it be if you can succeed in\nsending a picture over a telephone wire?\"\n\n\"What good, Dad? Why, lots of good. Just think how important it\nwill be in business, if you can make sure that you are talking to\nthe party you think you are. As it is now, unless you know the\nperson's voice, you can't tell that the man on the other end of\nthe wire is the person he says he is. And even a voice can be\nimitated.\"\n\n\"But if you know the person yourself, he can't be imitated. If you\nsee him, as well as hear his voice, you are sure of what you are\ndoing. Why, think of the big business deals that could be made\nover the telephone if the two parties could not only hear but see\neach other. It would be a dead sure thing then. And Mr. Brown\nwouldn't have to take Mr. Smith's word that it was he who was\ntalking. He could even get witnesses to look at the wire-image if\nhe wanted to, and so clinch the thing. It will prevent a lot of\nfrauds.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, maybe you're right. Go ahead. I'll say no more against\nyour plans. I wish you all success, and if I can help you, call on\nme.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Dad. I knew you'd feel that way when you understood. Now\nI'm going--\"\n\nBut what Tom Swift was going to do he did not say just then, for\nabove the heads of father and son sounded a rattling, crashing\nnoise, and the whole house seemed to shake. Then the voice of\nEradicate was heard yelling:\n\n\"Good land! Good land ob massy! Come out yeah, Massa Tom! Come\nright out yeah! Dere's a man on de roof an' he am all tangled up\nsuthin' scandalous! Come right out yeah befo' he falls and\ntranslocates his neck! Come on!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nBAD NEWS\n\n\nWith startled glances at each other, Tom and his father rushed\nfrom the library to the side of the house, whence came the cries\nof Eradicate.\n\n\"What is it, Rad! what is it?\" questioned Tom.\n\n\"Is someone hurt?\" Mr. Swift wanted to know.\n\n\"He mighty soon will be!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"Look where\nhe am holdin' on! Lucky fo' him he grabbed dat chimbley!\"\n\nTom and his father looked to where Eradicate pointed, and saw a\nstrange sight. A small biplane-airship had become entangled in\nsome of the aerials of Tom's wireless apparatus, and the craft had\nturned turtle, being held from falling by some of the wire braces.\n\nThe birdman had fallen out, but had managed to cling to the\nchimney, so that he had not reached the ground, and there he\nclung, while the motor of his airship was banging away, and\nrevolving the propeller blades dangerously close to his head.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" cried Tom, to the unknown birdman.\n\n\"No, but I'm likely to be unless I get out of here!\" was the\ngasped-out answer.\n\n\"Hold fast!\" cried Tom. \"We'll have you down in a jiffy. Here,\nRad, you get the long ladder. Where's Koku? That giant is never\naround when he's wanted. Find Koku, Rad, and send him here.\"\n\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom; directly, sah!\" and the colored man hastened\noff as fast as his aged legs would take him.\n\nAnd while preparations are thus under way to rescue the birdman\nfrom the roof, I will take just a few minutes to tell you a little\nsomething more about Tom Swift and his numerous inventions, as set\nforth in the previous books of this series.\n\n\"Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle\" was the first book, and in that I\nrelated how Tom made the acquaintance of a Mr. Wakefield Damon, of\nthe neighboring town of Waterford, and how Tom bought that\ngentleman's motor cycle, after it had tried to climb a tree with\nits rider in the saddle. Mr. Wakefield Damon was an odd man, whose\nfavorite expression was \"Bless my shoelaces!\" or something equally\nabsurd. Waterford was not far from Shopton, where Tom and his\nfather made their home.\n\nMr. Swift was also an inventor of note, and Tom soon followed in\nhis father's footsteps. They lived in a large house, with many\nshops about it, for their work at times required much machinery.\n\nMrs. Baggert was the housekeeper who looked after Tom and his\nfather, and got their meals, when they consented to take enough\ntime from their inventive work to eat. Another member of the\nhousehold was Eradicate Sampson, a genial old colored man, who\nsaid he was named Eradicate because he used to eradicate the dirt\nabout the place.\n\nKoku, just referred to by Tom, was an immense man, a veritable\ngiant, whom Tom had brought back with him from one of his trips,\nafter escaping from captivity. The young inventor really brought\ntwo giants, brothers they were, but one had gone to a museum, and\nthe other took service with our hero, making himself very useful\nwhen it came to lifting heavy machinery.\n\nTom had a close friend in Ned Newton, who was employed in the\nShopton bank. Another friend was Miss Mary Nestor, a young lady\nwhose life Tom had once saved. He had many other friends, and some\nenemies, whom you will meet from time to time in this story.\n\nAfter Tom had had many adventures on his motor cycle he acquired a\nmotor boat, and in that he and Ned went through some strenuous\ntimes on Lake Carlopa, near Tom's home. Then followed an airship,\nfor Tom got that craze, and in the book concerning that machine I\nrelated some of the things that happened to him. He had even more\nwonderful adventures in his submarine, and with his electric\nrunabout our hero was instrumental in saving a bank from ruin by\nmaking a trip in the speediest car on the road.\n\nAfter Tom Swift had sent his wireless message, and saved the\ncastaways of Earthquake Island, he thought he would give up his\ninventive work for a time, and settle down to a life of ease and\nquiet.\n\nBut the call of the spirit of adventure was still too strong for\nhim to resist. That was why he sought out the diamond makers, and\nlearned the secret of Phantom Mountain. And when he went to the\nCaves of Ice, and there saw his airship wrecked, Tom was well-nigh\ndiscouraged, But he managed to get back to civilization, and later\nundertook a journey to elephant land, with his powerful electric\nrifle.\n\nMarvelous adventures underground did Tom Swift have when he went\nto the City of Gold, and I have set down some of them in the book\nbearing the latter title. Later on he sought the platinum treasure\nin his air glider. And when Tom was taken captive, in giant land,\nonly his speedy airship saved him from a hard fate.\n\nBy this time moving pictures were beginning to occupy a large\nplace in the scientific, as well as the amusement world, and Tom\ninvented a Wizard Camera which did excellent work. Then came the\nneed of a powerful light, to enable Uncle Sam's custom officers on\nthe border to detect the smugglers, and Tom was successful in\nmaking his apparatus.\n\nHe thought he would take a rest after that, but with the opening\nof the Panama Canal came the need of powerful guns to protect that\nimportant waterway, and Tom made a Giant Cannon, which enabled the\nlongest shots on record to be fired.\n\nNow, some months had passed, after the successful trial of the big\nweapon, and Tom longed for new activities. He found them in the\nidea of a photo telephone, and he and his father were just talking\nof this when interrupted by the accident to the birdman on the\nroof of the Swift home.\n\n\"Have you got that ladder, Rad?\" cried the young inventor,\nanxiously, as he saw the dangerous position of the man from the\nairship.\n\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom! I'se a-camin' wif it!\"\n\n\"And where's Koku? We'll need him!\"\n\n\"He's a-camin', too!\"\n\n\"Here Koku!\" exclaimed a deep voice, and a big man came running\naround the corner of the house. \"What is it, Master?\"\n\n\"We must get him down, Koku!\" said Tom, simply. \"I will go up on\nthe roof. You had better come, too. Rad, go in the house and get a\nmattress from the bed. Put it down on the ground where he's likely\nto fall. Lively now!\"\n\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom!\"\n\n\"Me git my own ladder--dat one not strong 'nuff!\" grunted Koku,\nwho did not speak very good English. He had a very strong ladder,\nof his own make, built to hold his enormous bulk, and this he soon\nbrought and placed against the side of the house.\n\nMeanwhile Tom and his father had raised the one Eradicate had\nbrought, though Tom did most of the lifting, for his father was\nelderly, and had once suffered from heart trouble.\n\n\"We're coming for you!\" cried the young inventor as he began to\nascend the ladder, at the same time observing that the giant was\ncoming with his. \"Can you hold on a little longer?\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess so. But I dare not move for fear the propellers will\nstrike me.\"\n\n\"I see. I'll soon shut off the motor,\" said Tom. \"What happened,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"Well, I was flying over your house. I was on my way to pay you a\nvisit, but I didn't intend to do it in just this way,\" and the\nbirdman smiled grimly. \"I didn't see your wireless aerials until I\nwas plumb into them, and then it was too late. I hope I haven't\ndamaged them any.\"\n\n\"Oh, they are easily fixed,\" said Tom. \"I hope you and your\nbiplane are not damaged. This way, Koku!\" he called to the giant.\n\n\"Say, is--is he real, or am I seeing things?\" asked the aviator,\nas he looked at the big man.\n\n\"Oh, he's real, all right,\" laughed Tom. \"Now, then, I'm going to\nshut off your motor, and then you can quit hugging that chimney,\nand come down.\"\n\n\"I'll be real glad to,\" said the birdman.\n\nMaking his way cautiously along the gutters of the roof, Tom\nmanaged to reach the motor controls. He pulled out the electrical\nswitch, and with a sort of cough and groan the motor stopped. The\nbig propellers ceased revolving, and the aviator could leave his\nperch in safety.\n\nThis he did, edging along until he could climb down and meet Tom,\nwho stood near the ladder.\n\n\"Much obliged,\" said the birdman, as he shook hands with Tom. \"My\nname is Grant Halling. I'm a newcomer in Mansburg,\" he added,\nnaming a town not far from Shopton. \"I know you by reputation, so\nyou don't need to introduce yourself.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you,\" said the young inventor, cordially. \"Rather a\nqueer place to meet a friend,\" he went on with a laugh and a\nglance down to the ground. \"Can you climb?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'm used to that. The next thing will be to get my\nmachine down.\"\n\n\"Oh, we can manage that with Koku's help,\" spoke Tom. \"Koku, get\nsome ropes, and see what you and Rad can do toward getting the\naeroplane down,\" he added to the giant. \"Let me know if you need\nany help.\"\n\n\"Me can do!\" exclaimed the big man. \"Me fix him!\"\n\nTom and Mr. Halling made their way down the ladder, while the\ngiant proceeded to study out a plan for getting the airship off\nthe roof.\n\n\"You say you were coming over to see me, when you ran into my\nwireless aerials?\" asked Tom, curiously, when he had introduced\nhis father to the birdman.\n\n\"Yes,\" went on Mr. Halling. \"I have been having some trouble with\nmy motor, and I thought perhaps you could tell me what was wrong.\nMy friend, Mr. Wakefield Damon, sent me to you.\"\n\n\"What! Do you know Mr. Damon?\" cried Tom.\n\n\"I've known' him for some years. I met him in the West, but I\nhadn't seen him lately, until I came East. He sent me to see you,\nand said you would help me.\"\n\n\"Well, any friend of Mr. Damon's is a friend of mine!\" exclaimed\nTom, genially. \"I'll have a look at your machine as soon as Koku\ngets it down. How is Mr. Damon, anyhow? I haven't seen him in over\ntwo weeks.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to say he isn't very well, Mr. Swift.\"\n\n\"Is he ill? What is the trouble?\"\n\n\"He isn't exactly ill,\" went on Mr. Halling, \"but he is fretting\nhimself into a sickness, worrying over his lost fortune.\"\n\n\"His lost fortune!\" cried Tom, in surprise at the bad news\nconcerning his friend. \"I didn't know he had lost his money!\"\n\n\"He hasn't yet, but he's in a fair way to, he says. It's something\nabout bad investments, and he did speak of the trickery of one\nman, I didn't get the particulars. But he certainly feels very\nbadly over it.\"\n\n\"I should think he would,\" put in Mr. Swift. \"Tom, we must look\ninto this. If we can help Mr. Damon--\"\n\n\"We certainly will,\" interrupted Tom. \"Now come in the house, Mr.\nHalling. I'm sure you must be quite shaken up by your upset.\"\n\n\"I am, to tell you the truth, though it isn't the first accident\nI've had in my airship.\"\n\nThey were proceeding toward the house, when there came a cry from\nKoku, who had fastened a rope about the airship to lower it.\n\n\"Master! Master!\" cried the giant. \"The rope am slippin'. Grab the\nend of it!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTOM'S FAILURE\n\n\n\"Come on!\" cried Tom, quickly, as, turning, he saw the accident\nabout to happen. \"Your craft will surely be smashed if she slips\nto the ground, Mr. Halling!\"\n\n\"You're right! This seems to be my unlucky day!\" The birdman,\nlimping slightly from his fall, hurried with Tom to where a rope\ntrailed on the ground. Koku had fastened one end to the airship,\nand had taken a turn of the cable about the chimney. He had been\nlowering the biplane to the ground, but he had not allowed for its\ngreat weight, and the rope had slipped from his big hands.\n\nBut Tom and Mr. Halling were just in time. They grabbed the\nslipping hempen strands, and thus checked the falling craft until\nKoku could get a better grip.\n\n\"All right now,\" said the giant, when he had made fast the rope.\n\"Me fix now. Master can go.\"\n\n\"Think he can lower it?\" asked Mr. Halling, doubtfully.\n\n\"Oh, surely,\" said Tom. \"Koku's as strong as a horse. You needn't\nworry. He'll get it down all right. But you are limping.\"\n\n\"Yes, I jammed my leg a little.\"\n\n\"Don't you want a doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not for a little thing like that.\"\n\nBut Tom insisted on looking at his new friend's wound, and found\nquite a cut on the thigh, which the young inventor insisted on\nbinding up.\n\n\"That feels better,\" said the birdman, as he stretched out on a\ncouch. \"Now if you can look my machine over, and tell me what's\nthe matter with it, I'll be much obliged to you, and I'll get on\nmy way.\"\n\n\"Not quite so fast as that!\" laughed Tom. \"I wouldn't want to see\nyou start off with your lame leg, and certainly I would not want\nto see you use your aircraft after what she's gone through, until\nwe've given her a test. You can't tell what part you might have\nstrained.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you are right. But I think I'd better go to a\nhotel, or send for an auto and go home.\"\n\n\"Now you needn't do anything of the kind,\" spoke Tom, hospitably.\n\"We've got lots of room here, and for that matter we have plenty\nof autos and airships, too, as well as a motor boat. You just rest\nyourself here. Later we'll look over your craft.\"\n\nAfter dinner, when Mr. Halling said he felt much better, Tom\nagreed to go out with him and look at the airship. As he feared,\nhe found several things the matter with it, in addition to the\nmotor trouble which had been the cause for Mr. Halling's call on\nthe young inventor.\n\n\"Can she be fixed?\" asked the birdman, who explained that, as yet,\nhe was only an amateur in the practice of flying.\n\n\"Oh, yes, we can fix her up for you,\" said Tom. \"But it will take\nseveral days. You'll have to leave it here.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be glad to do that, for I know she will be all the\nbetter when you get through with her. But I think I am able to go\non home now, and I really ought to. There is some business I must\nattend to.\"\n\n\"Speaking of business,\" remarked Tom, \"can you tell me anything\nmore of Mr. Damon's financial troubles?\"\n\n\"No, not much. All I know is that when I called on him the other\nday I found him with his check book out, and he was doing a lot of\nfiguring. He looked pretty blue and downcast, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" spoke Tom, musingly. \"Mr. Damon is a very\ngood friend of mine, and I'd do anything to help him. I certainly\nwouldn't like to see him lose his fortune. Bad investments, you\nsay it was?\"\n\n\"Partly so, and yet I'm inclined to think if he does lose his\nmoney it will be due to some trickery. Mr. Damon is not the man to\nmake bad investments by himself.\"\n\n\"Indeed he is not,\" agreed Tom. \"You say he spoke of some man?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not definitely. He did not mention any name. But Mr.\nDamon was certainly quite blue.\"\n\n\"That's unlike him,\" remarked Tom. \"He is usually very jolly. He\nmust be feeling quite badly. I'll go over and have a talk with\nhim, as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Do. I think he would appreciate it. And now I must see about\ngetting home.\"\n\n\"I'll take you in one of my cars,\" said Tom, who had several\nautomobiles. \"I don't want to see you strain that injured leg of\nyours.\"\n\n\"You're very good--especially after I tangled up your wireless\naerials; but I didn't see them until I was right into them,\"\napologized Mr. Halling.\n\n\"They're a new kind of wire,\" said Tom, \"and are not very plain to\nsee. I must put up some warning signs. But don't worry about\ndamaging them. They were only up temporarily anyhow, and I was\ngoing to take them down to arrange for my photo telephone.\"\n\n\"Photo telephone, eh? Is that something new?\"\n\n\"It will be--if I can get it working,\" said Tom, with a smile.\n\nA little later Tom had taken Mr. Halling home, and then he set\nabout making arrangements for repairing the damaged airship. This\ntook him the better part of a week, but he did not regret the\ntime, for while he was working he was busy making plans for his\nnewest invention--the photo telephone.\n\nOne afternoon, when Tom had completed the repairs to the airship,\nand had spent some time setting up an experimental telephone line,\nthe young inventor received a call from his chum, Ned Newton.\n\n\"Well, well, what are you up to now?\" asked Ned, as he saw his\nchum seated in a booth, with a telephone receiver to his ear,\nmeanwhile looking steadily at a polished metal plate in front of\nhim. \"Trying to hypnotize yourself, Tom?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. Quiet, Ned, please. I'm trying to listen.\"\n\nNed was too familiar with his chum's work to take offense at this.\nThe young banker took a seat on a box, and silently watched Tom.\nThe inventor shifted several switches, pressed one button after\nanother, and tilted the polished metal plate at different angles.\nThen he closed the door of the little telephone booth, and Ned,\nthrough the ground glass door, saw a light shining.\n\n\"I wonder what new game Tom is up to?\" Ned mused.\n\nPresently the door opened, and Tom stuck out his head.\n\n\"Ned, come here,\" he invited. \"Look at that metal plate and see if\nyou can notice anything on it. I've been staring at it so steadily\nthat my eyes are full of sticks. See what you can make out.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Ned. \"No trick; is it? I won't be blown up,\nor get my eyes full of pepper; will I?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Of course not. I'm trying to make a photo telephone. I\nhave the telephone part down pat, but I can't see anything of the\nphoto image. See if you can.\"\n\nNed stared at the polished plate, while Tom did things to it,\nmaking electrical connections, and tilting it at various angles.\n\n\"See anything, Ned?\" asked Tom.\n\nThe other shook his head.\n\n\"Whom am I supposed to see?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, Koku is at the other end of the wire. I'm having him help\nme.\"\n\nNed gazed from the polished plate out of a side window of the\nshop, into the yard.\n\n\"Well, that Koku is certainly a wonderful giant,\" said Ned, with a\nlaugh.\n\n\"How so?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Why he can not be in two places at once. You say he ought to be\nat the other end of this wire, and there he is out there, spading\nup the garden.\"\n\nTom stared for a second and then exclaimed:\n\n\"Well, if that isn't the limit! I put him in the telephone booth\nin the machine shop, and told him to stay there until I was\nthrough. What in the world is he doing out there?\"\n\n\"Koku!\" he called to the giant, \"why didn't you stay at the\ntelephone where I put you? Why did you run away?\"\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the giant, who, for all his great size was a\nsimple chap, \"little thing go 'tick-tick' and then 'clap-clap!'\nKoku no like--Koku t'ink bad spirit in telumfoam--Koku come out!\"\n\n\"Well, no wonder I couldn't see any image on the plate!\" exclaimed\nTom. \"There was nobody there. Now, Ned, you try it; will you,\nplease?\"\n\n\"Sure. Anything to oblige!\"\n\n\"Then go in the other telephone booth. You can talk to me on the\nwire. Say anything you like--the telephone part is all right. Then\nyou just stand so that the light in the booth shines on your face.\nThe machine will do the rest--if it works.\"\n\nNed hurried off and was soon talking to his chum over the wire\nfrom the branch telephone in the machine shop. Ned stood in the\nglare of an electric light, and looked at a polished plate similar\nto the one in the other booth.\n\n\"Are you there, Ned?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Is the light on?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you're looking at the plate?\"\n\n\"Sure. Can you see any reflection in your plate?\"\n\n\"No, not a thing,\" answered Tom, and there was great\ndiscouragement in his voice. \"The thing is a failure, Ned. Come on\nback,\" and the young banker could hear his chum hang up the\ntelephone receiver at the other end.\n\n\"That's too bad,\" murmured Ned, knowing how Tom must feel. \"I'll\nhave to cheer him up a bit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nRUN DOWN\n\n\nWhen Ned Newton got back to where Tom sat in the small telephone\nbooth, the young banker found his chum staring rather moodily at\nthe polished metal plate on the shelf that held the talking\ninstrument.\n\n\"So it was no go; eh, Tom?\"\n\n\"No go at all, Ned, and I thought sure I had it right this time.\"\n\n\"Then this isn't your first experiment?\"\n\n\"Land no! I've been at it, off and on, for over a month, and I\ncan't seem to get any farther. I'm up against a snag now, good and\nhard.\"\n\n\"Then there wasn't any image on your plate?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Ned. I don't suppose you caught any glimpse of me in\nyour plate?\" asked Tom, half hopefully.\n\n\"No. I couldn't see a thing. So you are going to try and make this\nthing work both ways, are you?\"\n\n\"That's my intention, But I can fix it so that a person can\ncontrol the apparatus at his end, and only see the person he is\ntalking to, not being seen himself, unless he wishes it. That is,\nI hope to do that. Just now nobody can see anybody,\" and Tom\nsighed.\n\n\"Give it up,\" advised Ned. \"It's too hard a nut to crack, Tom!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I'll not give it up, Ned! I'm going to work along a new\nline. I must try a different solution of selenium on the metal\nplate. Perhaps I may have to try using a sensitized plate, and\ndevelop it later, though I do want to get the machine down so you\ncan see a perfect image without the need of developing. And I\nwill, too!\" cried Tom. \"I'll get some new selenium.\"\n\nEradicate, who came into the shop just then, heard the end of\nTom's remarks. A strange look came over his honest black face, and\nhe exclaimed:\n\n\"What all am dat, Massa Tom? Yo'ah gwine t' bring de new millenium\nheah? Dat's de end of de world, ain't it-dat millenium? Golly!\nDish yeah coon neber 'spected t' lib t' see dat. De millenium! Oh\nmah landy!\"\n\n\"No, Rad!\" laughed Tom. \"I was speaking about selenium, a sort of\nmetallic combination that is a peculiar conductor of electricity.\nThe more light that shines on it the better conductor it is, and\nthe less light, the poorer.\"\n\n\"It must be queer stuff,\" said Ned.\n\n\"It is,\" declared Tom. \"I think it is the only thing to use in\nthis photo telephone experiment, though I might try the metal\nplate method, as they did between Monte Carlo and Paris. But I am\nnot trying to make newspaper pictures.\"\n\n\"What is selenium, anyhow?\" asked Ned. \"Remember, Tom, I'm not up\non this scientific stuff as you are.\"\n\n\"Selenium,\" went on Tom, \"was discovered in 1817, by J. J.\nBerzelius, and he gave it that name from the Greek word for moon,\non account of selenium being so similar, in some ways, to\ntellurium. That last is named after the Latin word tellus, the\nearth.\"\n\n\"Do they dig it?\" Ned wanted to know.\n\n\"Well, sometimes selenium is found in combination with metals, in\nthe form of selenides, the more important minerals of that kind\nbeing eucharite, crooksite, clausthalite, naumannite and zorgite--\"\n\n\"Good night!\" interrupted Ned, with a laugh, holding up his hands.\n\"Stop it, Tom!\" he pleaded. \"You'll give me a headache with all\nthose big words.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're easy, once you get used to them,\" said the young\ninventor, with a smile. \"Perhaps it will be easier if I say that\nsometimes selenium is found in native sulphur. Selenium is usually\nobtained from the flue-dust or chamber deposits of some factory\nwhere sulphuric acid is made. They take this dust and treat it\nwith acids until they get the pure selenium. Sometimes selenium\ncomes in crystal forms, and again it is combined with various\nmetals for different uses.\"\n\n\"There's one good thing about it. There are several varieties, and\nI'll try them all before I give up.\"\n\n\"That's the way to talk!\" cried Ned. \"Never say die! Don't give up\nthe ship, and all that. But, Tom, what you need now is a little\nfun. You've been poking away at this too long. Come on out on the\nlake, and have a ride in the motor boat. It will do you good. It\nwill do me good. I'm a bit rusty myself--been working hard lately.\nCome on--let's go out on the lake.\"\n\n\"I believe I will!\" exclaimed Tom, after thinking it over for a\nmoment. \"I need a little fresh air. Sitting in that telephone\nbooth, trying to get an image on a plate, and not succeeding, has\ngotten on my nerves. I want to write out an order for Koku to take\nto town, though. I want to get some fresh selenium, and then I'm\ngoing to make new plates.\"\n\nTom made some memoranda, and then, giving Koku the order for the\nchemist, the young inventor closed up his shop, and went with Ned\ndown to Lake Carlopa, where the motor boat was moored.\n\nThis was not the same boat Tom had first purchased, some years\nago, but a comparatively new and powerful craft.\n\n\"It sure is one grand little day for a ride,\" remarked Ned, as he\ngot in the craft, while Tom looked over the engine.\n\n\"Yes, I'm glad you came over, and routed me out,\" said the young\ninventor. \"When I get going on a thing I don't know enough to\nstop. Oh, I forgot something!\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"I forgot to leave word about Mr. Railing's airship. It's all\nfixed and ready for him, but I put on a new control, and I wanted\nto explain to him about it. He might not know how to work it. I\nleft word with father, though, that if he came for it he must not\ntry it until he had seen me. I guess it will be all right. I don't\nwant to go back to the house now.\"\n\n\"No, it's too far,\" agreed Ned.\n\n\"I have it!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I'll telephone to dad from here, not\nto let Halling go up until I come back. He may not come for his\nmachine; but, if he does, it's best to be on the safe side Ned.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure.\"\n\nAccordingly, Tom 'phoned from his boat-house, and Mr. Swift\npromised to see the bird-man if he called. Then Ned and Tom gave\nthemselves up to the delights of a trip on the water.\n\nThe Kilo, which name Tom had selected for his new craft, was a\npowerful boat, and comfortable. It swept on down the lake, and\nmany other persons, in their pleasure craft, turned to look at\nTom's fine one.\n\n\"Lots of folks out to-day,\" observed Ned, as they went around a\npoint of the shore.\n\n\"Yes, quite a number,\" agreed Tom, leaning forward to adjust the\nmotor. \"I wonder what's got into her?\" he said, in some annoyance,\nas he made various adjustments. \"One of the cylinders is missing.\"\n\n\"Maybe it needs a new spark plug,\" suggested Ned.\n\n\"Maybe. Guess I'll stop and put one in.\"\n\nTom slowed down the motor, and headed his boat over toward shore,\nintending to tie up there for a while.\n\nAs he shifted the wheel he heard a cry behind him, and at the same\ntime a hoarse, domineering voice called out:\n\n\"Here, what do you mean, changing your course that way? Look out,\nor I'll run you down! Get out of my way, you land-lubber, you!\"\n\nStartled, Ned and Tom turned. They saw, rushing up on them from\nastern, a powerful red motor boat, at the wheel of which sat a\nstout man, with a very florid face and a commanding air.\n\n\"Get out of my way!\" he cried. \"I can't stop so short! Look out,\nor I'll run you down!\"\n\nTom, with a fierce feeling of resentment at the fellow, was about\nto shift the course of the Kilo, but he was too late.\n\nA moment later there came a smashing blow on the stern port\nquarter and the Kilo heeled over at a dangerous angle, while, with\na rending, splintering sound of wood, the big red motorboat swept\non past Tom and Ned, her rubstreak grinding along the side of the\nKilo.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSHARP WORDS\n\n\n\"Great Scott, Tom! What happened?\"\n\n\"I know as much as you, Ned. That fellow ran us down, that's all.\"\n\n\"Are we leaking?\" and with this question Ned sprang from his place\nnear the bow, and looked toward the stern, where the heaviest blow\nhad been struck.\n\nThe Kilo had swung back to an even keel again, but was still\nbobbing about on the water.\n\n\"Any hole there?\" cried Tom, as he swung the wheel over to point\nhis craft toward shore, in case she showed a tendency to sink.\n\n\"I can't see any hole,\" answered Ned. \"But water is coming in\nhere.\"\n\n\"Then there's a leak all right! Probably some of the seams are\nopened, or it may be coming in around the shaft stuffing-box.\nHere, Ned, take the wheel, and I'll start up the engine again,\"\nfor with the blow the motor had stopped.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned, as he again made his way\nforward.\n\n\"Take her to shore, of course. It's deep out here and I don't want\nher to go down at this point.\"\n\n\"Say, what do you think of that fellow, anyhow, Tom?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't like to tell you. Look, he's coming back.\"\n\nThis was so, for, as the boys watched, the big red motor boat had\nswung about in a circle and was headed for them.\n\n\"I'll tell him what I think of him, at any rate,\" murmured Tom, as\nhe bent over his motor. \"And, later on, I'll let the lawyers talk\nto him.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll sue him, Tom?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm certainly not going to let him run into me and spring a\nleak, for nothing. That won't go with me!\"\n\nBy this time Tom had the motor started, but he throttled it down\nso that it just turned the propeller. With it running at full\nspeed there was considerable vibration, and this would further\nopen the leaking seams. So much water might thus be let in that\nthe craft could not be gotten ashore.\n\n\"Head her over, Ned,\" cried Tom, when he found he had sufficient\nheadway. \"Steer for Ramsey's dock. There's a marine railway next\nto him, and I can haul her out for repairs.\"\n\n\"That's the talk, Tom!\" cried his chum.\n\nBy this time the big, red motor boat was close beside Tom's craft.\n\nThe man at the wheel, a stout-bodied and stout-faced man, with a\ncomplexion nearly the color of his boat, glared at the two young\nmen.\n\n\"What do you fellows mean?\" called out the man, in deep booming\ntones--tones that he tried to make imposing, but which, to the\ntrained ears of Tom and Ned, sounded only like the enraged bellow\nof some bully. \"What do you mean, I say? Getting on my course like\nthat!\"\n\nNed could see Tom biting his lips, and clenching his hands to keep\ndown his temper. But it was too much. To be run into, and then\ninsulted, was more than Tom could stand.\n\n\"Look here!\" he cried, standing up and facing the red-faced man,\n\"I don't know who you are, and I don't care. But I'll tell you one\nthing--you'll pay for the damage you did to my boat!\"\n\n\"I'll pay for it? Come, that's pretty good! Ha! Ha!\" laughed the\nself-important man. \"Why, I was thinking of making a complaint\nagainst you for crossing my course that way. If I find my boat is\ndamaged I shall certainly do so anyhow. Have we suffered any\ndamage, Snuffin?\" and he looked back at a grimy-faced mechinician\nwho was oiling the big, throbbing motor, which was now running\nwith the clutch out.\n\n\"No, sir, I don't think we're damaged, sir,\" answered the man,\ndeferentially.\n\n\"Well, it's a lucky thing for these land-lubbers that we aren't. I\nshould certainly sue them. The idea of crossing my course the way\nthey did. Weren't they in the wrong, Snuffin?\"\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, and glanced at Tom and Ned, as\nthough asking their indulgence.\n\n\"Well, I asked you a question, Snuffin!\" exclaimed the red-faced\nman sharply.\n\n\"Yes--yes, sir, they shouldn't have turned the way they did,\"\nanswered the man, in a low voice.\n\n\"Well, of all the nerve!\" murmured Tom, and stopped his motor.\nThen, stepping to the side of his disabled and leaking boat, he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Look here! Either you folks don't know anything about navigation\nrules, or you aren't heeding them. I had a perfect right to turn\nand go ashore when I did, for I found my engine was out of order,\nand I wanted to fix it. I blew the usual signal on the whistle,\nshowing my intention to turn off my course, and if you had been\nlistening you would have heard it.\"\n\n\"If you had even been watching you would have seen me shift, and\nthen, coming on at the speed you did, it was your place to warn me\nby a whistle, so that I could keep straight on until you had\npassed me.\"\n\n\"But you did not. You kept right on and ran into me, and the only\nwonder is that you didn't sink me. Talk about me getting in your\nway! Why, you deliberately ran me down after I had given the right\nsignal. I'll make a complaint against you, that's what I will.\"\n\nIf possible the red-faced man got even more rosy than usual. He\nfairly puffed up, he was so angry.\n\n\"Listen to that, will you, Snuffin!\" he cried. \"Listen to that! He\nsays he blew his whistle to tell us he was going to turn in.\"\n\n\"That's what I did!\" said Tom, calmly.\n\n\"Preposterous! Did you hear it, Snuffin?\" puffed the important\nman.\n\n\"Yes--yes, I think I did, sir,\" answered the machinist, in a\nhesitating voice.\n\n\"You did? What! You mean to tell me you heard their whistle?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Why--why--er--I--\" the big man puffed and blew, but seemed to\nfind no words in which to express himself. \"Snuffin, I'll have a\ntalk with you when we get home,\" he finally said, most significantly.\n\"The idea of saying you heard a whistle blown! There was nothing of\nthe kind! I shall make a complaint against these land-lubbers myself.\nDo you know who they are, Snuffin?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, sir,\" was the answer, as the man glanced at Tom. \"At\nleast I know one of them, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good. Give me his name. I'll attend to the rest.\"\n\nTom looked at the big man sharply. He had never seen him before,\nas far as he could recall. As for the machinist, the young\ninventor had a dim recollection that once the man might have\nworked in his shop.\n\n\"Go ahead, Snuffin!\" said the big man, mopping his face with a\nlarge silk handkerchief, which, even at that distance, gave out a\npowerful perfume. \"Go ahead, Snuffin, and we will settle this\nmatter later,\" and, adjusting a large rose in his buttonhole, the\nself-important individual took his place on the cushioned seat at\nthe wheel, while the big red motor boat drew off down the river.\n\n\"Well, of all the nerve!\" gasped Ned. \"Isn't he the limit?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" spoke Tom, with a little laugh. \"I'm sorry I lost my\ntemper, and even bothered to answer him. We'll let the lawyers do\nthe rest of the talking. Take the wheel, Ned.\"\n\n\"But are you going to let him get away like this, Tom? Without\nasking him to pay for the damage to your boat, when he was clearly\nin the wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll ask him to pay all right; but I'll do it the proper way.\nNow come on. If we stay here chinning much longer the Kilo will go\ndown. I must find out who he is. I think I know Snuffin--he used\nto work for me, I now recall.\"\n\n\"Don't you know who that big man is?\" asked Ned, as he took the\nwheel, while Tom again started the motor. The water was now almost\nup to the lower rim of the fly wheel.\n\n\"No; who is he?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Shallock Peters.\"\n\n\"Well, I know as much as I did before,\" laughed Tom. \"That doesn't\ntell me anything.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought everybody in the town knew Shallock Peters,\" went\non Ned. \"He tried to do some business with our bank, but was\nturned down. I hear he's gone to the other one, though. He's what\nwe call a get-rich-quick schemer, Tom--a promoter.\"\n\n\"I thought he acted like that sort of a character.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what he is. He's got half a dozen schemes under way,\nand he hasn't been in town over a month. I wonder you haven't seen\nor heard of him.\"\n\n\"I've been too busy over my photo telephone.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Well, this fellow Peters struck Shopton about a\nmonth ago. He bought the old Wardell homestead, and began to show\noff at once. He's got two autos, and this big motor boat. He\nalways goes around with a silk hat and a flower in his buttonhole.\nA big bluff--that's what he is.\"\n\n\"He acted so to me,\" was Tom's comment. \"Well, he isn't going to\nscare me. The idea! Why, he seemed to think we were in the wrong;\nwhereas he was, and his man knew it, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the poor fellow was afraid to say so. I felt sorry for\nhim.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" added Tom. \"Well, Kilo is out of commission for the\npresent. Guess we'll have to finish our outing by walking, Ned.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind. But it makes me mad to have a fellow act the\nway he did.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no good in getting mad,\" was Tom's smiling\nrejoinder. \"We'll take it out of him legally. That's the best way\nin the end. But I can't help saying I don't like Mr. Shallock\nPeters.\"\n\n\"And I don't either,\" added Ned.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA WARNING\n\n\n\"There, she's about right now, Ned. Hold her there!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, Captain Tom!\"\n\n\"Jove, she's leaking like a sieve! We only got her here just in\ntime!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Ned.\n\nTom and his chum had managed to get the Kilo to Ramsey's dock, and\nover the ways of the inclined marine railway that led from the\nshop on shore down into the river. Then, poling the craft along,\nuntil she was in the \"cradle,\" Ned held her there while Tom went\non shore to wind up the windlass that pulled the car, containing\nthe boat, up the incline.\n\n\"I'll give you a hand, as soon as I find she sets level,\" called\nNed, from his place in the boat.\n\n\"All right--don't worry. There are good gears on this windlass,\nand she works easy,\" replied Tom.\n\nIn a short time the boat was out of the water, but, as Tom grimly\nremarked, \"the water was not out of her,\" for a stream poured from\nthe stuffing-box, through which the propeller shaft entered, and\nwater also ran out through the seams that had been opened by the\ncollision.\n\n\"Quite a smash, Tom,\" observed the boat repairer, when he had come\nout to look over the Kilo. \"How'd it happen?\"\n\n\"Oh, Shallock Peters, with his big red boat, ran into us!\" said\nNed, sharply.\n\n\"Ha, Peters; eh?\" exclaimed the boatman. \"That's the second craft\nhe's damaged inside a week with his speed mania. There's Bert\nJohnson's little speeder over there,\" and he pointed to one over\nwhich some men were working. \"Had to put a whole new stern in her,\nand what do you think that man Peters did?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Tom, as he bent down to see how much damage his\ncraft had sustained.\n\n\"He wouldn't pay young Johnson a cent of money for the repairs,\"\nwent on Mr. Houston, the boatman. \"It was all Peters's fault,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Couldn't he make him pay?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Well, young Johnson asked for it--no more than right, too; but\nPeters only sneered and laughed at him.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he sue?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"Costs too much money to hire lawyers, I reckon. So he played you\nthe same trick; eh, Tom?\"\n\n\"Pretty much, yes. But he won't get off so easily, I can tell you\nthat!\" and there was a grim and determined look on the face of the\nyoung inventor. \"How long will it take to fix my boat, Mr.\nHouston?\"\n\n\"Nigh onto two weeks, Tom. I'm terrible rushed now.\"\n\nTom whistled ruefully.\n\n\"I could do it myself quicker, if I could get her back to my\nshop,\" he said. \"But she'd sink on the home trip. All right, do\nthe best you can, Mr. Houston.\"\n\n\"I will that, Tom.\"\n\nThe two chums walked out of the boat-repair place.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Tom?\" asked Ned, as they strolled\nalong.\n\n\"Well, since we can't go motor boating, I guess I may as well go\nback and see if that new supply of selenium has come. I do want to\nget my photo telephone working, Ned.\"\n\n\"And that's all the outing you're going to take--less than an\nhour!\" exclaimed Ned, reproachfully.\n\n\"Oh, well, all you wanted to do was to get me out of a rut, as you\ncalled it,\" laughed Tom. \"And you've done it--you and Mr. Peters\ntogether. It jolted up my brain, and I guess I can think better\nnow. Come on back and watch me tinker away, Ned.\"\n\n\"Not much! I'm going to stay out and get some fresh air while I\ncan. You'd better, too.\"\n\n\"I will, later.\"\n\nSo Tom turned back to his workshop, and Ned strolled on into the\ncountry, for his day's work at the bank was over. And for some\ntime after that--until far into the night--Tom Swift worked at the\nknotty problem of the photo telephone.\n\nBut the young inventor was baffled. Try as he might, he could not\nget the image to show on the metal plate, nor could he get any\nresults by using a regular photographic plate, and developing it\nafterward.\n\n\"There is something wrong with the transmission of the light waves\nover the wire,\" Tom confessed to his father.\n\n\"You'll never do it, Tom,\" said the aged inventor. \"You are only\nwasting a whole lot of time.\"\n\n\"Well, as I haven't anything else to do now, it isn't much loss,\"\nspoke Tom, ruefully. \"But I'm going to make this work, Dad!\"\n\n\"All right, son. It's up to you. Only I tell you it can't be\ndone.\"\n\nTom, himself, was almost ready to admit this, when, a week later,\nhe seemed to be no nearer a solution of the problem than he was at\nfirst. He had tried everything he could think of, and he had\nEradicate and Koku, the giant, almost distracted, by making them\nstay in small telephone booths for hours at a time, while the\nyoung inventor tried to get some reflection of one face or the\nother to come over the wire.\n\nKoku finally got so nervous over the matter, that he flatly\nrefused to \"pose\" any longer, so Tom was forced to use Eradicate.\nAs for that elderly man of all work, after many trials, all\nunsuccessful, he remarked:\n\n\"Massa Tom, I reckon I knows what's wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes, Rad? Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"Mah face am too black--dat's de trouble. You done want a\nwhite-complected gen'man to stand in dat booth an' look at dat lookin'\nglass plate. I'se too black! I suah is!\"\n\n\"No, that isn't it, Rad,\" laughed Tom, hopelessly. \"If the thing\nworks at all it will send a black man's face over the wire as well\nas a white man's. I guess the truth of it is that you're like\nKoku. You're getting tired. I don't know as I blame you. I'm\ngetting a bit weary myself. I'm going to take a rest. I'll send\nfor another kind of selenium crystals I've heard of, and we'll try\nthem. In the meanwhile--I'll take a little vacation.\"\n\n\"Get out my small airship, Rad, and I'll take a little flight.\"\n\n\"Dat's de way to talk, Massa Tom,\" was the glad rejoinder.\n\n\"I'm going over to see Mr. Damon, Father,\" announced Tom to Mr.\nSwift a little later, when his speedy monoplane was waiting for\nhim. \"I haven't seen him in some time, and I'd like to get at the\ntruth of what Mr. Halling said about Mr. Damon's fortune being in\ndanger. I'll be back soon.\"\n\n\"All right, Tom. And say--\"\n\n\"Yes, Dad, what is it?\" asked Tom, as he paused in the act of\ngetting in the seat.\n\n\"If he wants any ready cash, you know we've got plenty.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. I was going to tell him we'd help him out.\"\n\nThen, as Koku spun the propeller blades, Tom grasped the steering\nwheel, and, tilting the elevating rudder, he was soon soaring into\nthe air, he and his craft becoming smaller and smaller as they\nwere lost to sight in the distance, while the rattle and roar of\nthe powerful motor became fainter.\n\nIn a comparatively short time Tom had made a successful landing in\nthe big yard in front of Mr. Damon's house, and, walking up the\npath, kept a lookout for his friend.\n\n\"I wonder why he didn't come out to meet me?\" mused Tom, for\nusually when the eccentric man heard the throbbing of Tom's motor,\nhe was out waiting for the young inventor. But this time it was\nnot the case.\n\n\"Is Mr. Damon in?\" Tom asked of the maid who answered his ring.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Swift. You'll find him in the library,\" and she ushered\nhim in.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Tom,\" greeted Mr. Damon, but the tone was so listless,\nand his friend's manner so gloomy that the young inventor was\nquite embarrassed.\n\n\"Have a chair,\" went on Mr. Damon. \"I'll talk to you in a minute,\nTom. I've got to finish this letter, and it's a hard one to write,\nlet me tell you.\"\n\nNow Tom was more astonished than ever. Not once had Mr. Damon\n\"blessed,\" anything, and when this did not happen Tom was sure\nsomething was wrong. He waited until his friend had sealed the\nletter, and turned to him with a sigh. Then Tom said boldly:\n\n\"Mr. Damon, is it true that you're having hard luck--in money\nmatters?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Tom, I'm afraid I am,\" was the quick answer. \"But who\ntold you?\"\n\n\"Grant Halling. He was over to get me to fix his airship,\" and Tom\nbriefly related what had happened.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I did mention the matter to him,\" went on Mr. Damon, and\nhis tone was still listless. \"So he told you; did he? Well,\nmatters aren't any better, Tom. In fact, they're worse. I just had\nto write to a man who was asking for help, and I had to refuse\nhim, though he needs it very much. The truth is I hadn't the\nmoney. Tom, I'm afraid I'm going to be a very poor man soon.\"\n\n\"Impossible, Mr. Damon! Why, I thought your investments--\"\n\n\"I've made some bad ones of late, Tom. I've been pretty foolish,\nI'm afraid. I drew out some money I had in government bonds, and\ninvested in certain stocks sold by a Mr. Shallock Peters.\"\n\n\"Shallock Peters!\" cried Tom, almost jumping out of his chair.\n\"Why, I know him--I mean I've met him.\"\n\n\"Have you, Tom? Well, then, all I've got to say is to steer clear\nof him, my boy. Don't have anything to do with him,\" and, with\nsomething of a return of his usual energy Mr. Damon banged his\nfist down on his desk. \"Give him a wide berth, Tom, and if you see\nhim coming, turn your back. He'd talk a miser into giving him his\nlast cent. Keep away from Shallock Peters, Tom. Bless my necktie,\nhe's a scoundrel, that's what he is!\" and again Mr. Damon banged\nhis desk forcibly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSOFT WORDS\n\n\n\"Well, I'm glad of one thing!\" exclaimed Tom, when the ink bottle\nand the paper cutter on Mr. Damon's desk had ceased rattling,\nbecause of the violence of the blow. \"I'm glad of one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that, Tom?\" asked his friend.\n\n\"I heard you bless something at last--the first time since I came\nin.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" and Mr. Damon laughed. \"Well, Tom, I haven't been blessing\nthings lately--that's a fact. I haven't had the heart for it.\nThere are too many business complications. I wish I'd never met\nthis Peters.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Tom. \"My motor boat would not have been damaged\nthen.\"\n\n\"Did he do that, Tom?\"\n\n\"He certainly did, and then he accused me of being at fault.\"\n\n\"That would be just like him. Tell me about it, Tom.\"\n\nWhen the young inventor finished the story of the collision Mr.\nDamon sat silent for a moment. Then he remarked slowly:\n\n\"That's just like Peters. A big bluff--that's what he is. I wish\nI'd discovered that fact sooner--I'd be money in pocket. But I\nallowed myself to be deceived by his talk about big profits. At\nfirst he seemed like a smart business man, and he certainly had\nfine recommendations. But I am inclined to believe, now, that the\nrecommendations were forged.\"\n\n\"What did he do to you, Mr. Damon?\" asked Tom, with ready\nsympathy.\n\n\"It's too complicated to go into details over, Tom, but to make a\nlong story short, he got me to invest nearly all my fortune in\nsome enterprises that, I fear, are doomed to failure. And if they\ndo fail, I'll be a ruined man.\"\n\n\"No, you won't!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That's one reason why I came here\nto-day. Father told me to offer you all the ready money you needed\nto get out of your trouble. How much do you need, Mr. Damon?\"\n\n\"Bless my collar button! That's like your father, Tom,\" and now\nMr. Damon seemed more like his old self. \"Bless my shoes, a man\nnever knows who his real friends are until trouble comes. I can't\nsay how I thank you and your father, Tom. But I'm not going to\ntake advantage of him.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be taking any advantage of him, Mr. Damon. He has\nmoney lying idle, and he'd like to have you use it.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, I might use it, if I had only myself to think about.\nBut there's no use in throwing good money after bad. If I took\nyours now this fellow Peters would only get it, and that would be\nthe last of it.\"\n\n\"No, Tom, thank you and your father just the same, but I'll try to\nweather the storm a bit longer myself. Then, if I do go down I\nwon't drag anybody else with me. I'll hang on to the wreck a bit\nlonger. The storm may blow over, or--or something may happen to\nthis fellow Peters.\"\n\n\"Has he really got you in his grip, Mr. Damon?\"\n\n\"He has, and, to a certain extent, it's my own fault. I should\nhave been suspicious of him. And now, Tom, let me give you a\nfurther word of warning. You heard me say to steer clear of this\nPeters?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm going to. But I'm going to make him pay for damaging\nmy boat, if I possibly can.\"\n\n\"Maybe it would be wiser not to try that, Tom. I tell you he's a\ntricky man. And one thing more. I have heard that this man Peters\nmakes a specialty of organizing companies to take up new\ninventions.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" asked Tom, interestedly.\n\n\"Yes, but that's as far as it goes. Peters gets the invention, and\nthe man, out of whose brain it came, gets nothing.\"\n\n\"In other words, he swindles them?\"\n\n\"That's it, Tom. If not in one way, then in another. He cheats\nthem out of the profits of their inventions. So I want to warn you\nto be on the lookout.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Tom. \"Peters will get nothing from my father\nor me. We'll be on our guard. Not that I think he will try it, but\nit's just as well to be warned. I didn't like him from the moment\nhe ran into me, and, now that I know what he has done to you, I\nlike him still less. He won't get anything from me!\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you say so, Tom. I wish he'd gotten nothing out\nof me.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you won't let my father help you, financially, Mr.\nDamon?\"\n\n\"No, Tom, at least not for the present. I'm going to make another\nfight to hold on to my fortune. If I find I can't do it alone,\nthen I'll call on you. I'm real glad you called. Bless my\nshoestring! I feel better now.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" laughed Tom, and he saw that his friend was in a\nbetter state of mind, as his \"blessings\" showed.\n\nTom remained for a little longer, talking to Mr. Damon, and then\ntook his leave, flying back home in the airship.\n\n\"Gen'man t' see yo', Massa Tom,\" announced Eradicate, as he helped\nTom wheel the monoplane back into the shed.\n\n\"Is that so, Rad? Where is he?\"\n\n\"Settin' in th' library. Yo' father am out, so I asted him in\ndere.\"\n\n\"That's right, Rad. Who is he, do you know?\"\n\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom, I doan't. He shore does use a pow'ful nice\nperfume on his pocket hanky, though. Yum-yum!\"\n\n\"Perfume!\" exclaimed Tom, his mind going back to the day he had\nhad the trouble with Mr. Peters. \"Is he a big, red-faced man,\nRad?\"\n\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom. He's a white-faced, skinny man.\"\n\n\"Then it can't be Peters,\" mused Tom. \"I guess perhaps it's that\nlawyer I wrote to about bringing suit to get back what it cost me\nto have the Kilo fixed. I'll see him at once. Oh, by the way, it\nisn't Mr. Grant Halling; is it? The gentleman who got tangled up\nin our aerials with his airship? Is it he?\"\n\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom. 'Tain't him.\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps he had gotten into more trouble,\" mused Tom, as\nhe took off his airship \"togs,\" and started for the house. For Mr.\nHalling had called for his repaired airship some time ago, and had\npromised to pay Tom another and more conventional visit, some\nfuture day.\n\nTom did not know the visitor whom he greeted in the library a\nlittle later. The man, as Eradicate had said, was rather pale of\nface, and certainly he was not very fleshy.\n\n\"Mr. Tom Swift, I think?\" said the man, rising and holding out his\nhand.\n\n\"That's my name. I don't believe I know you, though.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't your reputation,\" said the man, with a laugh that\nTom did not like. \"We can't all be great inventors like you,\" and,\nsomehow, Tom liked the man less than before, for he detected an\nundertone of sneering patronage in the words. Tom disliked praise,\nand he felt that this was not sincere.\n\n\"I have called on a little matter of business,\" went on the man.\n\"My name is Harrison Boylan, and I represent Mr. Shallock Peters.\"\n\nInstinctively Tom stiffened. Receiving a call from a\nrepresentative of the man against whom Mr. Damon had warned him\nonly a short time before was a strange coincidence, Tom thought.\n\n\"You had some little accident, when your motor boat and that of\nMr. Peters collided, a brief time ago; did you not?\" went on Mr.\nBoylan.\n\n\"I did,\" said Tom, and, as he motioned the caller to be seated Tom\nsaw, with a start, that some of the drawings of his photo\ntelephone were lying on a desk in plain sight. They were within\neasy reach of the man, and Tom thought the sheets looked as though\nthey had been recently handled. They were not in the orderly array\nTom had made of them before going out.\n\n\"If he is a spy, and has been looking at them,\" mused Tom, \"he may\nsteal my invention.\" Then he calmed himself, as he realized that\nhe, himself, had not yet perfected his latest idea. \"I guess he\ncouldn't make much of the drawings,\" Tom thought.\n\n\"Yes, the collision was most unfortunate,\" went on Mr. Boylan,\n\"and Mr. Peters has instructed me to say--\"\n\n\"If he's told you to say that it was my fault, you may as well\nsave your time,\" cut in Tom. \"I don't want to be impolite, but I\nhave my own opinion of the affair. And I might add that I have\ninstructed a lawyer to begin a suit against Mr. Peters--\"\n\n\"No necessity for that at all!\" interrupted the man, in soft\naccents. \"No necessity at all. I am sorry you did that, for there\nwas no need. Mr. Peters has instructed me to say that he realizes\nthe accident was entirely his own fault, and he is very willing--nay,\nanxious, to pay all damages. In fact, that is why I am here,\nand I am empowered, my dear Mr. Swift, to offer you five hundred\ndollars, to pay for the repairs to your motor boat. If that is not\nenough--\"\n\nThe man paused, and drew a thick wallet from his pocket. Tom felt\na little embarrassed over what he had said.\n\n\"Oh,\" spoke the young inventor, \"the repair bill is only about\nthree hundred dollars. I'm sorry--\"\n\n\"Now that's all right, Mr. Swift! It's all right,\" and the man,\nwith his soft words, raised a white, restraining hand. \"Not\nanother word. Mr. Peters did not know who you were that day he so\nunfortunately ran into you. If he had, he would not have spoken as\nhe did. He supposed you were some amateur motor-boatist, and he\nwas--well, he admits it--he was provoked.\"\n\n\"Since then he has made inquiries, and, learning who you were, he\nat once authorized me to make a settlement in full. So if five\nhundred dollars--\"\n\n\"The repair bill,\" said Tom, and his voice was not very cordial,\nin spite of the other's persuasive smile, \"the bill came to three\nhundred forty-seven dollars. Here is the receipted bill. I paid\nit, and, to be frank with you, I intended bringing suit against\nMr. Peters for that sum.\"\n\n\"No need, no need at all, I assure you!\" interrupted Mr. Boylan,\nas he counted off some bills. \"There you are, and I regret that\nyou and Mr. Peters had such a misunderstanding. It was all his\nfault, and he wants to apologize to you.\"\n\n\"The apology is accepted,\" said Tom, and he smiled a trifle. \"Also\nthe money. I take it merely as a matter of justice, for I assure\nyou that Mr. Peters's own machinist will say the accident was his\nemployer's fault.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it, not the least in the world,\" said the caller.\n\"And now that I have this disagreeable business over, let me speak\nof something more pleasant.\"\n\nInstinctively Tom felt that now the real object of the man's call\nwould be made plain--that the matter of paying the damages was\nonly a blind. Tom steeled himself for what was to come.\n\n\"You know, I suppose,\" went on Mr. Boylan, smiling at Tom, \"that\nMr. Peters is a man of many and large interests.\"\n\n\"I have heard something like that,\" said Tom, cautiously.\n\n\"Yes. Well, he is an organizer--a promoter, if you like. He\nsupplies the money for large enterprises, and is, therefore, a\nbenefactor of the human race. Where persons have no cash with\nwhich to exploit their--well, say their inventions. Mr. Peters\ntakes them, and makes money out of them.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" thought Tom, grimly.\n\n\"In other cases, where an inventor is working at a handicap, say\nwith too many interests, Mr. Peters takes hold of one of his\nideas, and makes it pay much better than the inventor has been\nable to do.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Peters has heard of you, and he would like to do you\ngood.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess he would,\" thought Tom. \"He would like to do me--and\ndo me good and brown. Here's where I've got to play a game\nmyself.\"\n\n\"And so,\" went on Mr. Boylan, \"Mr. Peters has sent me to you to\nask you to allow him to exploit one, or several, of your\ninventions. He will form a large stock company, put one of your\ninventions on the market, and make you a rich man. Now what do you\nsay?\" and he looked at Tom and smiled--smiled, the young inventor\ncould not help thinking, like a cat looking at a mouse. \"What do\nyou say, Mr. Swift?\"\n\nFor a moment Tom did not answer. Then getting up and opening the\nlibrary door, to indicate that the interview was at an end, the\nyoung inventor smiled, and said:\n\n\"Tell Mr. Peters that I thank him, but that I have nothing for him\nto exploit, or with which to form a company to market.\"\n\n\"Wha--what!\" faltered the visitor. \"Do you mean to say you will\nnot take advantage of his remarkable offer?\"\n\n\"That's just what I mean to say,\" replied Tom, with a smile.\n\n\"You won't do business with Mr. Peters? You won't let him do you\ngood?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tom, quietly.\n\n\"Why--why, that's the strangest--the most preposterous thing I\never heard of!\" protested Mr. Boylan. \"What--what shall I say to\nMr. Peters?\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Tom, \"tell him, from me, and excuse the slang, if\nyou like, but tell him there is--nothing doing!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTOM IS BAFFLED\n\n\nAmazement held Mr. Boylan silent for a moment, and then, staring\nat Tom, as though he could not believe what he had heard the young\ninventor say, the representative of Mr. Peters exclaimed:\n\n\"Nothing doing?\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\" repeated Tom, calmly.\n\n\"But--but you don't understand, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh, but indeed I do.\"\n\n\"Then you refuse to let my friend, Mr. Peters, exploit some of\nyour inventions?\"\n\n\"I refuse absolutely.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now. Take an invention that hasn't been very\nsuccessful.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like to boast,\" said Tom with a smile, \"but all of\nmy inventions have been successful. They don't need any aid from\nMr. Peters, thank you.\"\n\n\"But this one!\" went on the visitor eagerly, \"this one about some\nnew kind of telephone,\" and he motioned to the drawings on the\ntable. \"Has that been a success? Excuse me for having looked at\nthe plans, but I did not think you would mind. Has that telephone\nbeen a success? If it has not perhaps Mr. Peters could form a\ncompany to--\"\n\n\"How did you know those drawings referred to a telephone?\" asked\nTom, suspiciously, for the papers did not make it clear just what\nthe invention was.\n\n\"Why, I understood--I heard, in fact, that you were working on a\nnew photo telephone, and--\"\n\n\"Who told you?\" asked Tom quickly.\n\n\"Oh, no one in particular. The colored man who sent me here\nmentioned--\"\n\n\"Eradicate!\" thought Tom. \"He must have been talking. That isn't\nlike him. I must look into this.\"\n\nThen to his caller he said:\n\n\"Really, you must excuse me, Mr. Boylan, but I don't care to do\nany business with Mr. Peters. Tell him, with my thanks, that there\nis really nothing doing in his line. I prefer to exploit my own\ninventions.\"\n\n\"That is your last word?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Tom, as he gathered up the drawings.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Boylan, and Tom could not help thinking there was\na veiled threat in his tones, \"you will regret this. You will be\nsorry for not having accepted this offer.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Tom, confidently. \"Good-day.\"\n\nThe young inventor sat for some time thinking deeply, when his\nvisitor had gone. He called Eradicate to him, and gently\nquestioned the old colored man, for Eradicate was ageing fast of\nlate, and Tom did not want him to feel badly.\n\nIt developed that the servant had been closely cross-questioned by\nMr. Boylan, while he was waiting for Tom, and it was small wonder\nthat the old colored man had let slip a reference to the photo\ntelephone. But he really knew nothing of the details of the\ninvention, so he could have given out no secrets.\n\n\"But at the same time,\" mused Tom, \"I must be on guard against\nthese fellows. That Boylan seems a pretty slick sort of a chap. As\nfor Peters, he's a big 'bluff,' to be perfectly frank. I'm glad I\nhad Mr. Damon's warning in mind, or I might have been tempted to\ndo business with him.\"\n\n\"Now to get busy at this photo telephone again. I'm going to try a\ntotally different system of transmission. I'll use an alternating\ncurrent on the third wire, and see if that makes it any better.\nAnd I'll put in the most sensitive selenium plate I can make. I'm\ngoing to have this thing a success.\"\n\nTom carefully examined the drawings of his invention, at which\npapers Mr. Boylan had confessed to looking. As far as the young\ninventor could tell none was missing, and as they were not\ncompleted it would be hard work for anyone not familiar with them\nto have gotten any of Tom's ideas.\n\n\"But at the same time I'm going to be on my guard,\" mused Tom.\n\"And now for another trial.\"\n\nTom Swift worked hard during the following week, and so closely\ndid he stick to his home and workshop that he did not even pay a\nvisit to Mr. Damon, so he did not learn in what condition that\ngentleman's affairs were. Tom even denied himself to his chum Ned,\nso taken up was the young inventor with working out the telephone\nproblem, until Ned fairly forced himself into the shop one day,\nand insisted on Tom coming out.\n\n\"You need some fresh air!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Come on out in the\nmotor boat again. She's all fixed now; isn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom, \"but--\"\n\n\"Oh, 'but me no buts,' as Mr. Shakespeare would say. Come on, Tom.\nIt will do you good. I want a spin myself.\"\n\n\"All right, I will go for a little while,\" agreed Tom. \"I am\nfeeling a bit rusty, and my head seems filled with cobwebs.\"\n\n\"Can't get the old thing to come out properly; eh?\"\n\n\"No. I guess dad was more than half right when he said it couldn't\nbe done. But I haven't given up. Maybe I'll think of some new plan\nif I take a little run. Come along.\"\n\nThey went down to the boat house, and soon were out on the lake in\nthe Kilo.\n\n\"She runs better since you had her fixed,\" remarked Ned.\n\n\"Yes, they did a good job.\"\n\n\"Did you sue Peters?\"\n\n\"Didn't have to. He sent the money,\" and Tom told of his interview\nwith Mr. Boylan. This was news to Ned, as was also the financial\ntrouble of Mr. Damon.\n\n\"Well,\" said the young banker, \"that bears out what I had heard of\nPeters--that he was a get-rich-quick chap, and a good one to steer\nclear of.\"\n\n\"Speaking of steering clear,\" laughed Tom, \"there he is now, in\nhis big boat,\" and he pointed to a red blur coming up the lake.\n\"I'll give him a wide enough berth this time.\"\n\nBut though Mr. Peters, in his powerful motor boat, passed close to\nTom's more modest craft, the big man did not glance toward our\nhero and his chum. Nor did Mr. Boylan, who was with his friend,\nlook over.\n\n\"I guess they've had enough of you,\" chuckled Ned.\n\n\"Probably he wishes he hadn't paid me that money,\" said Tom. \"Very\nlikely he thought, after he handed it over, that I'd be only too\nwilling to let him manage one of my inventions. But he has another\nguess coming.\"\n\nTom and Ned rode on for some distance, thoroughly enjoying the\nspin on the lake that fine Summer day. They stopped for lunch at a\npicnic resort, and coming back in the cool of the evening they\nfound themselves in the midst of a little flotilla of pleasure\ncraft, all decorated with Japanese lanterns.\n\n\"Better slow down a bit,\" Ned advised Tom, for many of the\npleasure craft were canoes and light row boats. \"Our wash may\nupset some of them.\"\n\n\"Guess you're right, old man,\" agreed Tom, as he closed the\ngasoline throttle, to reduce speed. Hardly had he done so than\nthere broke in upon the merry shouts and singing of the pleasure-seekers\nthe staccato exhaust of a powerful motor boat, coming directly\nbehind Tom's craft.\n\nThen came the shrill warning of an electrical siren horn.\n\n\"Somebody's in a hurry,\" observed Tom.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ned. \"It sounds like Peters's boat, too.\"\n\n\"It is!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Here he comes. He ought to know better\nthan to cut through this raft of boats at that speed.\"\n\n\"Is he headed toward us?\"\n\n\"No, I guess he's had enough of that. But look at him!\"\n\nWith undiminished speed the burly promoter was driving his boat\non. The big vibrating horn kept up its clamor, and a powerful\nsearchlight in front dazzled the eyes.\n\n\"Look out! Look out!\" cried several.\n\nMany of the rowers and paddlers made haste to clear a lane for the\nbig, speedy motor craft, and Peters and his friends (for there\nwere several men in his boat now) seemed to accept this as a\nmatter of course, and their right.\n\n\"Somebody'll be swamped!\" exclaimed Ned.\n\nHardly had he spoken than, as the big red boat dashed past in a\nsmother of foam, there came a startled cry in girls' voices.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Tom. \"That canoe's upset! Speed her up, Ned! We've\ngot to get 'em!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nA GLEAM OF HOPE\n\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Over this way! There's their canoe!\"\n\n\"Look out for that motor boat!\"\n\n\"Who was it ran them down? They ought to be arrested!\"\n\nThese were only a few of the cries that followed the upsetting of\nthe frail canoe by the wash from the powerful red boat. On Tom's\nKilo there was a small, electrical searchlight which he had not\nyet switched on. But, with his call to Ned Newton to speed up the\nmotor, that had been slowed down, Tom, with one turn of his\nfingers, set the lamp aglow, while, with the other hand, he\nwhirled the wheel over to head his craft for the spot where he saw\ntwo figures struggling in the water.\n\nFortunately the lanterns on the various canoes and row-boats, as\nwell as the light on the bow of Tom's Kilo, made an illumination\nthat gave the rescuers a good chance to work. Many other boats\nbesides Tom's had headed for the scene, but his was the more\npractical, since the others--all quite small ones--were pretty\nwell filled.\n\n\"There they are, Ned!\" Tom suddenly cried. \"Throw out the clutch!\nI'll get 'em!\"\n\n\"Want any help?\"\n\n\"No, you stay at the engine, and mind what I say. Reverse now!\nWe're going to pass them!\"\n\nNed threw in the backing gear, and the screw churned the water to\nfoam under the stern of the Kilo.\n\nTom leaned over the bow, and made a grab for the gasping,\nstruggling figure of a girl in the water. At the same time he had\ntossed overboard a cork life ring, attached to a rope which, in\nturn, was made fast to the forward deck-cleat. \"Grab that!\" cried\nTom. \"Hold on, and I'll have you out in a second! That's enough,\nNed! Shut her off!\"\n\nThe Kilo came to a standstill, and, a second later, Tom had pulled\ninto his boat one of the girls. She would have collapsed, and\nfallen in a heap on the bottom boards, had not Ned, who had come\nforward from the engine, caught her.\n\nThen Tom, again leaning over the side, pulled in the other girl,\nwho was clinging to the life ring.\n\n\"You're all right,\" Tom assured her, as she came up, gasping,\nchoking and crying hysterically. \"You're all right!\"\n\n\"Is--is Minnie saved?\" she sobbed.\n\n\"Yes, Grace! I'm here,\" answered the one Ned was supporting.\n\n\"Oh, wasn't it terrible!\" cried the second girl Tom had saved.\n\n\"I thought we would be drowned, even though we can swim.\"\n\n\"Yes, it--it was so--so sudden!\" gasped her companion. \"What\nhappened?\"\n\n\"The wash from that big boat upset you,\" explained Tom. \"That\nfellow ought to be ashamed of himself, rushing along the way he\ndid. Now, can I take you girls anywhere? Your canoe seems to have\ndrifted off.\"\n\n\"I have it!\" someone called. \"It's turned over, but I can tow it\nto shore.\"\n\n\"And I'll take the girls home,\" offered a gentleman in a large\nrowboat. \"My wife will look after them. They live near us,\" and he\nmentioned his own name and the names of the two girls Tom had\nsaved. The young inventor did not know them, but he introduced\nhimself and Ned.\n\n\"This is the annual moonlight outing of our little boat club,\"\nexplained the man who had offered to look after the girls, \"and it\nis the first time we ever had an accident. This was not our fault,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Indeed it was not,\" agreed Tom, after he had helped the two\ndripping young ladies into the rowboat. \"It was due to Mr.\nPeters's speed mania.\"\n\n\"I shall make a complaint against him to the navigation\nauthorities,\" said Mr. Ralston, who was looking after the girls.\n\"He must think he, alone, has any rights on this lake.\"\n\nWith renewed thanks to Tom and Ned, the rescued girls were rowed\noff to their homes, while the interrupted water carnival was\ncontinued.\n\n\"Some little excitement; eh, Tom?\" remarked Ned, when they were\nonce more under way.\n\n\"Yes. We seem to run into that fellow Peters, or some of his\ndoings, quite often lately.\"\n\n\"And it isn't a good sign, either,\" murmured Ned.\n\nFor some minutes after that Tom did not speak. In fact he was so\nsilent that Ned at last inquired:\n\n\"What's the matter, Tom--in love?\"\n\n\"Far from it. But, Ned, I've got an idea.\"\n\n\"And I've got a wet suit of clothes where that nice young lady\nfainted in my arms. I'm soaked.\"\n\n\"That's what gave me the idea--the water, I mean. I noticed how\neverything was reflected in it, and, do you know, Ned, I believe I\nhave been working on the wrong principle for my photo telephone.\"\n\n\"Wrong, Tom, how is that?\"\n\n\"Why, I've been using a dry plate, and I think I should have used\na wet one. You know how even in a little puddle of water on the\nsidewalk you can see yourself reflected?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've often seen that.\"\n\n\"Well then, 'bless my watch chain!' as Mr. Damon would say, I\nthink I've got just what I want. I'm going to try a wet plate now,\nand I think it will work. Come on now. Speed up! I'm in a great\nbig hurry to get home and try it!\"\n\n\"Well, Tom, I sure will be glad if you've got the right idea,\"\nlaughed Ned. \"It will be worth getting wet through for, if you\nstrike something. Good luck!\"\n\nTom could hardly wait to fasten up his boat for the night, so\neager was he to get to his shop laboratory and try the new idea. A\ngleam of hope had come to him.\n\nIt was still early evening, and Tom, when enticed out by Ned, had\nleft his photo telephone apparatus in readiness to go on with his\ntrials as soon as he should have come back.\n\n\"Now for it, Ned!\" exclaimed the young inventor, as he took off\nhis coat. \"First I'll sensitize a selenium plate, and then I'll\nwet it. Water is always a good conductor of electricity, and it's\na wonder that I forgot that when I was planning this photo\ntelephone. But seeing the sparkle of lights, and the reflection of\nourselves in the lake to-night, brought it back to me. Now then,\nyou haven't anything special to do; have you?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Tom.\"\n\n\"That's good. Then you get in this other telephone closet--the one\nin the casting shop. I'll put a prepared plate in there, and one\nin the booth where I'm to sit. Then I'll switch on the current,\nand we'll see if I can make you out, and you notice whether my\nimage appears on your plate.\"\n\nIt took some little time to make ready for this new test. Tom was\nfilled with enthusiasm, and he was sure it was going to be\nsuccessful this time. Ned watched him prepare the selenium\nplates--plates that were so sensitive to illumination that, in the\ndark, the metal would hardly transmit a current of electricity, but\nin the light would do so readily, its conductivity depending on the\namount of light it received.\n\n\"There, I guess we're all ready, Ned,\" announced Tom, at last.\n\"Now you go to your little coop, and I'll shut myself up in mine.\nWe can talk over the telephone.\"\n\nSeated in the little booth in one of the smaller of Tom's shops,\nNed proceeded with his part in the new experiment. A small shelf\nhad been fitted up in the booth, or closet, and on this was the\napparatus, consisting of a portable telephone set, and a small\nbox, in which was set a selenium plate. This plate had been wet by\na spray of water in order to test Tom's new theory.\n\nIn a similar booth, several hundred feet away, and in another\nbuilding, Tom took his place. The two booths were connected by\nwires, and in each one was an electric light.\n\n\"All ready, Ned?\" asked Tom, through the telephone.\n\n\"All ready,\" came the answer.\n\n\"Now then, turn on your switch--the one I showed you--and look\nright at the sensitized plate. Then turn out your light, and\nslowly turn it on. It's a new kind, and the light comes up\ngradually, like gas or an oil lamp. Turn it on easily.\"\n\n\"I get you, Tom.\"\n\nNed did as requested. Slowly the illumination in the booth\nincreased.\n\n\"Do you get anything, Tom?\" asked Ned, over the wire.\n\n\"Not yet,\" was the somewhat discouraged answer. \"Go ahead, turn on\nmore light, and keep your face close to the plate.\"\n\nNed did so.\n\n\"How about it now?\" he asked, a moment later.\n\n\"Nothing--yet,\" was the answer. And then suddenly Tom's voice rose\nto a scream over the wire.\n\n\"Ned--Ned! Quick!\" he called. \"Come here--I--I--\"\n\nThe voice died off into a meaningless gurgle.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nMIDNIGHT VISITORS\n\n\nNed Newton never knew exactly how he got out of the telephone\nbooth. He seemed to give but one jump, tearing the clamped\nreceiver from his ear, and almost upsetting the photo apparatus in\nhis mad rush to help Tom. Certain it is, however, that he did get\nout, and a few seconds later he was speeding toward the shop where\nTom had taken his position in a booth.\n\nNed burst in, crying out:\n\n\"Tom! What is it? What happened? What's the matter?\"\n\nThere was no answer. Fearing the worst, Ned hurried to the small\nbooth, in one corner of the big, dimly lighted shop. He could see\nTom's lamp burning in the telephone compartment.\n\n\"Tom! Tom!\" called the young banker.\n\nStill there was no answer, and Ned, springing forward, threw open\nthe double, sound-proof door of the booth. Then he saw Tom lying\nunconscious, with his head and arms on the table in front of him,\nwhile the low buzzing of the electrical apparatus in the\ntransmitting box told that the current had not been shut off.\n\n\"Tom! Tom!\" cried Ned in his chum's ear. He shook him by the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Are you hurt? What is the matter?\"\n\nThe young inventor seemed unconscious, and for a moment Ned had a\nwild idea that Tom had been shocked to death, possibly by some\ncrossed live wire coming in contact with the telephone circuit.\n\n\"But that couldn't have happened, or I'd have been shocked\nmyself,\" mused Ned.\n\nThen he became aware of a curious, sweet, sickish odor in the\nbooth. It was overpowering. Ned felt himself growing dizzy.\n\n\"I have it--chloroform!\" he gasped. \"In some way Tom has been\novercome by chloroform. I've got to get him to the fresh air.\"\n\nOnce he had solved the puzzle of Tom's unconsciousness, Ned was\nquick to act. He caught Tom under the arms, and dragged him out of\nthe booth, and to the outer door of the shop. Almost before Ned\nhad reached there with his limp burden, Tom began to revive, and\nsoon the fresh, cool night air completed the work.\n\n\"I--I,\" began the young inventor. \"Ned, I--I--\"\n\n\"Now take it easy, Tom,\" advised his chum. \"You'll be all right in\na few minutes. What happened? Shall I call your father, or Koku?\"\n\n\"No--don't. It would only--only alarm dad,\" faltered Tom. \"I'm\ngetting all right now. But he--he nearly had me, Ned!\"\n\n\"He had you? What do you mean, Tom? Who had you?\"\n\n\"I don't know who it was, but when I was talking to you over the\nwire, all of a sudden I felt a hand behind me. It slipped over my\nmouth and nose, and I smelled chloroform. I knew right away\nsomething was wrong, and I called to you. That's all I remember. I\nguess I must have gone off.\"\n\n\"You did,\" spoke Ned. \"You were unconscious when I got to you. I\ncouldn't imagine what had happened. First I thought it was an\nelectrical shock. Then I smelled that chloroform. But who could it\nhave been, Tom?\"\n\n\"Give it up, Ned! I haven't the slightest idea.\"\n\n\"Could they have been going to rob you?\"\n\n\"I haven't a thing but a nickel watch on me,\" went on Tom. \"I left\nall my cash in the house. If it was robbery, it wasn't me,\npersonally, they were after.\"\n\n\"What then? Some of your inventions?\"\n\n\"That's my idea now, Ned. You remember some years ago Jake Burke\nand his gang held me up and took one of dad's patents away from\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard you mention that. It was when you first got your\nmotor cycle; wasn't it?\"\n\n\"That's right. Well, what I was going to say was that they used\nchloroform on me then, and--\"\n\n\"You think this is the same crowd? Why, I thought they were\ncaptured.\"\n\n\"No, they got away, but I haven't heard anything of them in years.\nNow it may be they have come back for revenge, for you know we got\nback the stolen property.\"\n\n\"That's right. Say, Tom, it might be so. What are you going to do\nabout it?\"\n\n\"I hardly know. If it was Jake Burke, alias Happy Harry, and his\ncrowd, including Appleson, Morse and Featherton, they're a bad\nlot. I wouldn't want father to know they were around, for he'd be\nsure to worry himself sick. He never really got over the time they\nattacked me, and got the patent away. Dad sure thought he was\nruined then.\"\n\n\"Now if I tell him I was chloroformed again to-night, and that I\nthink it was Burke and his crowd, he'd be sure to get ill over it.\nSo I'm just going to keep mum.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it's the best plan. But you ought to do something.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will, Ned, don't worry about that. I feel much better now.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\" asked Ned, his curiosity not yet satisfied.\n\n\"I don't know, exactly. I was in the booth, talking to you, and\nnot paying much attention to anything else. I was adjusting and\nreadjusting the current, trying to get that image to appear on the\nplate. All at once, I felt someone back of me, and, before I could\nturn, that hand, with the chloroform sponge, was over my mouth and\nnose. I struggled, and called out, but it wasn't much use.\"\n\n\"But they didn't do anything else--they didn't take anything; did\nthey, Tom?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Ned. We'll have to look around. They must have\nsneaked into the shop. I left the door open, you see. It would\nhave been easy enough.\"\n\n\"How many were there?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell. I only felt one fellow at me; but he may have\nhad others with him.\"\n\n\"What particular invention were they after, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know. There are several models in here that\nwould be valuable. I know one thing, though, they couldn't have\nbeen after my photo telephone,\" and Tom laughed grimly.\n\n\"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.\n\n\"Because it's a failure--that's what! It's a dead, sure failure,\nNed, and I'm going to give it up!\" and Tom spoke bitterly.\n\n\"Oh, don't say that!\" urged his chum. \"You may be right on the\nverge of perfecting it, Tom. Didn't you see any image at all on\nthe plate?\"\n\n\"Not a shadow. I must be on the wrong track. Well, never mind\nabout that now. I'm going to look around, and see if those fellows\ntook anything.\"\n\nTom was feeling more like himself again, the effects of the\nchloroform having passed away. He had breathed the fumes of it for\nonly a little while, so no harm had been done. He and Ned made an\nexamination of the shop, but found nothing missing.\n\nThere were no traces of the intruders, however, though the two\nchums looked carefully about outside the building.\n\n\"You were too quick for them, Ned,\" said Tom. \"You came as soon as\nI called. They heard me speaking, and must have known that I had\ngiven the alarm.\"\n\n\"Yes, I didn't lose any time,\" admitted Ned, \"but I didn't see a\nsign of anyone as I ran up.\"\n\n\"They must have been pretty quick at getting away. Well, now to\ndecide what's best to do to-night.\"\n\nAfter some consultation and consideration it was decided to set\nthe burglar alarms in every building of the Swift plant. Some time\nprevious, when he had been working on a number of valuable\ninventions, unscrupulous men had tried to steal his ideas and\nmodels. To prevent this Tom had arranged a system of burglar\nalarms, and had also fitted up a wizard camera that would take\nmoving pictures of anyone coming within its focus. The camera\ncould be set to work at night, in connection with the burglar\nalarms.\n\nThe apparatus was effective, and thus an end was put to the\nefforts of the criminals. But now it seemed Tom would have to take\nnew precautionary measures. His camera, however, was not\navailable, as he had loaned it to a scientific society for\nexhibition.\n\n\"But we'll attach the burglar wires,\" decided Tom, \"and see what\nhappens.\"\n\n\"It might be a good plan to have Koku on guard,\" said Tom's chum.\n\"That giant could handle four or five of the chaps as easily as\nyou and I could tackle one.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Tom. \"I'll put him on guard. Whew! That\nchloroform is giving me a headache. Guess I'll go to bed. I wish\nyou'd stay over to-night, Ned, if you haven't anything else to do.\nI may need you.\"\n\n\"Then of course I'll stay, Tom. I'll telephone home that I won't\nbe in.\"\n\nA little later Tom had put away his new photo telephone apparatus,\nand had prepared for the warm reception of any unbidden callers.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't started on this new invention,\" said Tom, half\nbitterly, as he locked up the main parts of his machine, \"I know\nit will never work.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes it will,\" spoke Ned, cheerfully. \"You never failed yet,\nTom Swift, in anything you undertook, and you're not going to\nnow.\"\n\n\"Well, that's good of you to say, Ned, but I think you're wrong\nthis time. But I'm not going to think any more about it to-night,\nanyhow. Now to find Koku and put him on watch.\"\n\nThe giant listened carefully to Tom's simple instructions.\n\n\"If any bad men come in the night, Koku,\" said the young inventor,\n\"you catch them!\"\n\n\"Yes, master, me catch!\" said Koku, grimly. \"Me catch!\" and he\nstretched out his powerful arms, and clenched his big hands in a\nway that boded no good to evildoers.\n\nNothing was said to Mr. Swift, to Mrs. Baggert, or to Eradicate\nabout what had happened, for Tom did not want to worry them. The\nburglar alarms were set, Koku took his place where he could watch\nthe signals, and at the same time be ready to rush out, for,\nsomehow, Tom had an idea that the men who had attacked him would\ncome back.\n\nTom and Ned occupied adjoining rooms, and soon were ready for bed.\nBut, somehow, Tom could not sleep. He lay awake, tossing from side\nto side, and, in spite of his resolution not to think about his\nphoto telephone invention, his mind ran on nothing but that.\n\n\"I can't see what next to do to make it work,\" he told himself,\nover and over again. \"Something is wrong--but what?\"\n\nAt length he fell into a fitful doze, and he had a wild dream that\nhe was sliding down hill on a big mirror in which all sorts of\nreflections were seen--reflections that he could not get to show\nin the selenium plates.\n\nThen Tom felt the mirror bobbing up and down like a motor boat in\na storm. He felt the vibration, and he heard a voice calling in\nhis ear:\n\n\"Get up, Tom! Get up!\"\n\n\"Yes! What is it?\" he sleepily exclaimed,\n\n\"Hush!\" was the caution he heard, and then he realized that his\ndream had been caused by Ned shaking him.\n\n\"Well?\" whispered Tom, in tense tones.\n\n\"Midnight visitors!\" answered his chum \"The burglar alarm has just\ngone off! The airship hangar drop fell. Koku has gone out. Come\non!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE AIRSHIP IS TAKEN\n\n\nTom leaped silently out of bed, and stood for a moment half\ndazed, so soundly had he been sleeping.\n\n\"Come on!\" urged Ned softly, realizing that his chum had not fully\ncomprehended. \"Koku will hold them until we get there. I haven't\nroused anyone else.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" whispered Tom, as he began putting on his clothes.\n\"I don't want father to know. When did it happen?\"\n\n\"Just a little while ago. I couldn't sleep very well, but I fell\ninto a doze, and then I heard the buzzer of the alarm go off. I\nsaw that the drop, showing that the hangar had been entered, had\nfallen. I got to the window in time to see Koku going toward the\nshed from his little coop. Then I came to you.\"\n\n\"Glad you did,\" answered Tom. \"I didn't think I was sleeping so\nsoundly.\"\n\nTogether the two chums made their way from their rooms down the\ndimly-lighted hall to a side door, whence they could reach the\nairship hangar, or shed.\n\n\"Won't we need something--a gun or--\" began Ned.\n\n\"Clubs are better--especially at night when you can't see to aim\nvery well,\" whispered back Tom. \"I've got a couple of good ones\ndownstairs. I could use my electric rifle, and set it merely to\ndisable temporarily whoever the charge hit, but it's a little too\nrisky. Koku has a habit of getting in the way at the most\nunexpected times. He's so big, you know. I think clubs will be\nbest.\"\n\n\"All right, Tom, just as you say,\" agreed Ned. \"But who do you\nthink it can be?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea. Probably the same fellows who were\nafter me before, though. This time I'll find out what their game\nis, and what they're after.\"\n\nThe chums reached the lower hall, and there Tom picked out two\nAfrican war clubs which he had brought back with him from one of\nhis many trips into wild lands.\n\n\"These are just the thing!\" exclaimed Ned, swinging his about.\n\n\"Careful,\" cautioned Tom, \"If you hit something you'll rouse the\nhouse, and I don't want my father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing\nof Eradicate, awakened.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" murmured Ned. \"But we'd better be getting a move on.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Tom. He dropped into a side pocket a small\nbut powerful electric flash lamp, and then he and Ned let\nthemselves out.\n\nThere had been a bright moon, but it was now overcast by clouds.\nHowever, there was sufficient light to enable the two lads to see\nobjects quite clearly. All about them were the various buildings\nthat made up the manufacturing and experimental plant of Tom Swift\nand his father. Farthest away from the house was the big shed\nwhere once Tom had kept a balloon, but which was now given over to\nhis several airships. In front of it was a big, level grassy\nspace, needed to enable the aircraft to get a \"running start\"\nbefore they could mount into the clouds.\n\n\"See anything of Koku?\" whispered Ned.\n\n\"No,\" answered Tom, in the same cautious voice. \"I guess he must\nbe hiding--\"\n\n\"There he goes now!\" hissed Ned, pointing to a big figure that was\napproaching the hangar. It was undoubtedly that of the giant, and\nhe could be seen, in the dim light, stalking cautiously along.\n\n\"I wonder where the uninvited guests are?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Probably in the airship shed,\" answered Ned. \"Koku was after them\nas soon as the alarm went off, and they couldn't have gotten away.\nThey must be inside there yet. But what can their game be?\"\n\n\"It's hard to say,\" admitted Tom. \"They may be trying to get\nsomething belonging to me, or they may imagine they can pick up\nsome valuable secrets. Or they may--\" He stopped suddenly, and\nthen exclaimed:\n\n\"Come on, Ned! They're after one of the airships! That's it! My\nbig biplane is all ready to start, and they can get it in motion\ninside of a few seconds. Oh, why didn't I hurry?\" he added,\nbitterly.\n\nBut the hangar was still some distance away, and it would take two\nor three minutes of running to reach it.\n\nMeanwhile, and at the instant Tom had his thought of the possible\ntheft of his biggest aircraft, something happened.\n\nThe doors of the shed were suddenly thrown open, and the two boys\ncould see the large airship being wheeled out. The hazy light of\nthe moon behind the clouds shone on the expanse of white planes,\nand on the fish-tail rudder, one of Tom's latest ideas.\n\n\"Hey, there!\" cried Tom, warningly.\n\n\"Leave that alone!\" yelled Ned.\n\n\"Koku! Koku!\" shouted Tom, shrilly. \"Get after those fellows!\"\n\n\"Me get!\" boomed out the giant, in his deep voice.\n\nHe had been standing near the entrance to the hangar, probably\nwaiting for developments, and watching for the arrival of Tom and\nNed. The big form was seen to leap forward, and then several dark\nshadows swarmed from around the airship, and were seen to fling\nthemselves upon the giant.\n\n\"That's a fight!\" cried Ned. \"They're attacking him!\"\n\n\"Koku can take care of himself!\" murmured Tom. \"But come on. I\ndon't see what their game is.\"\n\nHe understood a moment later, however, for while several of the\nmidnight visitors were engaged in a hand-to-hand tussle with the\ngiant there came a sharp, throbbing roar of the airship motor in\nmotion. The propellers were being whirled rapidly about.\n\n\"Koku! Koku!\" cried Tom, for he was still some distance off.\n\"Never mind them! Don't let the airship be taken!\"\n\nBut Koku could only grunt. Big and strong as he was, half a dozen\nmen attacking him at once hampered him. He threw them from him,\none after another, and was gradually making his way toward the now\nslowly-moving airship. But would he be in time?\n\nTom and Ned could not hope to reach the machine before Koku,\nthough they were running at top speed.\n\n\"Koku! Koku!\" yelled Tom. \"Don't let them get away!\"\n\nBut Koku could only grunt--harder this time--for he fell heavily,\nbeing tripped by a stick thrust between his legs. He lay for a\nmoment stunned.\n\n\"They're going to get away!\" panted Tom, making an effort to\nincrease his speed.\n\n\"That's what!\" agreed Ned.\n\nEven as they spoke the roar of the airship motor increased.\nSeveral of the dark forms which had been engaged in the struggle\nwith Koku were seen to pick themselves up, and run toward the\nairship, that was now in motion, moving on the bicycle wheels over\nthe grass plot, preparatory to mounting upward in the sky.\n\n\"Stop! Stop!\" commanded Tom. But it was all in vain.\n\nThe men leaped aboard the airship, which could carry six persons,\nand a moment later, with a deafening roar, as the engine opened up\nfull, the big craft shot upward, taking away all but two of the\nmidnight visitors. These, who had seemingly been stunned by Koku,\nnow arose from the ground, and staggered off in the darkness.\n\n\"Get them!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"We must see to Koku!\" added Ned, \"Look, there goes your airship,\nTom!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. But we can't stop that now. Let's see if we can get\na clue in these fellows!\"\n\nHe pointed toward the two who had run off in the dark underbrush\nsurrounding the hangar plaza, and he and Ned trailed them as well\nas they could. But from the first they knew it would be useless,\nfor there were many hiding places, and, a little way beyond, was a\nclump of trees.\n\nAfter a short search Tom gave up reluctantly, and came back to\nwhere Koku was now sitting on the ground.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked of the giant.\n\n\"My mind hurt--that all,\" said the big man.\n\n\"I guess he means his feelings are hurt,\" Tom explained. \"Do you\nknow who they were, Koku?\"\n\n\"No, master.\"\n\n\"But we must do something!\" cried Ned. \"They've got your airship,\nTom.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said the young inventor, calmly. \"But we can't do\nanything now. You can hardly hear her, let alone see her. She's\nmoving fast!\"\n\nHe pointed upward to the darkness. Like some black bird of prey\nthe airship was already lost to sight, though it would have seemed\nas if her white planes might render her visible. But she had moved\nso swiftly that, during the short search, she had already\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Aren't you going to do anything?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"Certainly,\" spoke Tom. \"I'm going to telephone an alarm to all\nthe nearby towns. This is certainly a queer game, Ned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE\n\n\nDisappointed and puzzled, Tom and Ned went to where Koku was\nstanding in rather a dazed attitude. The giant, like all large\nbodies, moved slowly, not only bodily but mentally. He could\nunderstand exactly what had happened, except that he had not\nprevailed over the \"pygmies\" who had attacked him. They had been\ntoo many for him.\n\n\"Let's take a look inside,\" suggested Tom, when, by another glance\nupward, he had made sure that all trace of his big airship was\ngone. \"Maybe we can get a clue. Then, Koku, you tell us what\nhappened.\"\n\n\"It all happened to me,\" said the giant, simply. \"Me no make\nanything happen to them.\"\n\n\"That's about right,\" laughed Tom, ruefully. \"It all happened to\nus.\"\n\nThe lights in the hangar were switched on, but a careful search\nrevealed little. The men, half a dozen or more, had come evidently\nwell prepared for the taking away of Tom Swift's airship, and they\nhad done so.\n\nEntrance had been effected by forcing a small side door. True, the\nburglar alarm had given notice of the presence of the men, but Tom\nand Ned had not acted quite quickly enough. Koku had been at the\nhangar almost as soon as the men themselves, but he had watched\nand waited for orders, instead of going in at once, and this had\ngiven the intruders time to wheel out the craft and start the\nmotor.\n\n\"Why didn't you jump right in on them when you saw what they were\nup to, Koku?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Me wait for master. Me think master want to see who men were. Me\ngo in--they run.\"\n\n\"Well, of course that's so, in a way,\" admitted Tom. \"They\nprobably would have run, but they'd have run WITHOUT my airship\ninstead of WITH it, if they hadn't had time to get it outside the\nhangar. However, there's no use in crying over lost biplanes. The\nnext thing is how to get her back. Did you know any of the men,\nKoku?\"\n\n\"No, master.\"\n\n\"Then we haven't any clue that way. They laid their plans well.\nThey just let you tangle yourself up with them, Koku, while the\nhead ones got the motor going; an easy matter, since it was all\nready to start. Then they tripped you, Koku, and as many of them\nas could, made a jump for the machine. Then they were off.\"\n\n\"Well, what's the next thing to do?\" asked Ned, when another look\nabout the shed had shown that not the slightest clue was\navailable.\n\n\"I'm going to do some telephoning,\" Tom stated. \"A big airship\nlike mine can't go scooting around the country without being\nnoticed. And those fellows can't go on forever. They've got to\nhave gasoline and oil, and to get them they'll have to come down.\nI'll get it back, sooner or later; but the question is: Why did\nthey take her?\"\n\n\"To sell,\" suggested Ned.\n\n\"I think not,\" Tom said. \"A big airship like mine isn't easy to\nsell. People who would buy it would ask questions that might not\neasily be answered. I'm inclined to think that some other reason\nmade them take her, and it's up to us to find out what it was.\nLet's go into the house.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" suddenly exclaimed Ned, holding up his hand for silence.\nThey all heard footsteps outside the hangar.\n\nTom sprang to the door, flashing his electric light, and a voice\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Golly! Chicken thieves!\"\n\n\"Oh, is it you, Eradicate?\" asked the young inventor, with a\nlaugh. \"No, it isn't chicken thieves--they were after bigger game\nthis time.\"\n\n\"Suffin happen?\" asked the colored man. \"Massa Swift he heah a\nnoise, an' see a light, an' he sent me out yeah t' see what all am\ngwine on.\"\n\n\"Yes, something happened,\" admitted Tom. \"They got the Eagle,\nRad.\"\n\n\"What! Yo' big airship?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Huh! Dat's too bad, Massa Tom. I suah am sorry t' heah dat. Who\ndone it?\"\n\n\"We don't know, Rad.\"\n\n\"Maybe it was dat low-down cousin ob mine what tried t' git mah\nchickens, onct!\"\n\n\"No, Rad, it wasn't your cousin. But I'll telephone the alarm to\nthe police. They may be able to help me get the Eagle back.\"\n\nWithin the next hour several messages were sent to the authorities\nof nearby towns, asking them to be on the watch for the stolen\nairship. This was about all that could be done, and after Mr.\nSwift had been told the story of the night's happenings, everyone\nwent back to bed again.\n\nFurther search the next morning brought forth no clues, though\nTom, Ned and the others beat about in the bushes where the men had\ndisappeared.\n\nOne or two reports were heard from surrounding towns, to the\neffect that several persons had heard a strange throbbing sound in\nthe night, that, possibly, was caused by the passage of the\nairship overhead. One such report came from Waterford, the home\ntown of Mr. Damon.\n\n\"Let's go over there,\" suggested Ned, to his chum. \"I'd like to\nsee our friend, and maybe we can get some other clues by\ncirculating around there.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" spoke Tom, rather listlessly.\n\n\"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.\n\n\"Well, I ought to be working on my photo telephone,\" was the\nanswer. \"I've got a new idea now. I'm going to try a different\nkind of current, and use a more sensitive plate. And I'll use a\ntungsten filament lamp in the sending booth.\"\n\n\"Oh, let your experiments go for a little while, Tom,\" suggested\nNed. \"Come on over to Mr. Damon's. The trouble with you is that\nyou keep too long at a thing, once you start.\"\n\n\"That's the only way to succeed,\" remarked Tom. \"Really, Ned,\nwhile I feel sorry about the airship, of course, I ought to be\nworking on my telephone. I'll get the Eagle back sooner or later.\"\n\n\"That's not the way to talk, Tom. Let's follow up this clue.\"\n\n\"Well, if you insist on it I suppose I may as well go. We'll take\nthe little monoplane. I've fixed her up to carry double. I guess--\"\n\nTom Swift broke off suddenly, as the telephone at his elbow rang.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, taking off the receiver. \"Yes, this is Tom\nSwift. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Damon! Eh! What's that? Mr. Damon\nhas disappeared? You don't tell me! Disappeared! Yes, yes, I can\ncome right over. Be there in a few minutes. Eh? You don't know\nwhat to make of it? Oh, well, maybe it can easily be explained.\nYes, Ned Newton and I will be right over. Don't worry.\"\n\nTom hung up the receiver and turned to his chum.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" he asked.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Damon mysteriously vanished last night, and this morning\nword came from his bankers that every cent of his fortune had\ndisappeared! He's lost everything!\"\n\n\"Maybe--maybe--\" hesitated Ned.\n\n\"No, Mr. Damon isn't that kind of a man,\" said Tom, stoutly. \"He\nhasn't made away with himself.\"\n\n\"But something is wrong!\"\n\n\"Evidently, and it's up to us to find out what it is. I shouldn't\nbe surprised but that he knew of this coming trouble and started\nout to prevent it if he could.\"\n\n\"But he wouldn't disappear and make his wife worry.\"\n\n\"No, that's so. Well, we'll have to go over there and find out all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Say, Tom!\" exclaimed Ned, as they were getting the small, but\nswift monoplane ready for the flight, \"could there be any\nconnection with the disappearance of Mr. Damon and the taking of\nthe Eagle?\"\n\nTom started in surprise.\n\n\"How could there be?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Ned. \"It was only an idea.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see what Mrs. Damon has to say,\" spoke the young\ninventor, as he took his seat beside Ned, and motioned to Koku to\ntwirl the propeller.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE TELEPHONE PICTURE\n\n\n\"Oh, Tom Swift! I'm so glad to see you!\"\n\nMrs. Damon clasped her arms, in motherly fashion, about the young\ninventor. He held her close, and his own eyes were not free from\ntears as he witnessed the grief of his best friend's wife.\n\n\"Now, don't worry, Mrs. Damon,\" said Tom, sympathetically.\n\"Everything will be all right,\" and he led her to a chair.\n\n\"All right, Tom! How can it be?\" and the lady raised a tear-stained\nface. \"My husband has disappeared, without a word! It's just as\nif the earth had opened and swallowed him up! I can't find a trace\nof him! How can it be all right?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll find him, Mrs. Damon. Don't worry. Ned and I will get\nright to work, and I'll have all the police and detectives within\nfifty miles on the search--if we have to go that far.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's awfully good of you, Tom. I--I didn't know who else to\nturn to in my trouble but you.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't you come to me? I'd do anything for you and Mr.\nDamon. Now tell me all about it.\"\n\nTom and Ned had just arrived at the Damon home in the airship, to\nfind the wife of the eccentric man almost distracted over her\nhusband's strange disappearance.\n\n\"It happened last night,\" Mrs. Damon said, when she was somewhat\ncomposed. \"Last night about twelve o'clock.\"\n\n\"Twelve o'clock!\" cried Tom, in surprise \"Why that's about the\ntime--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly.\n\n\"What were you going to say?\" asked Mrs. Damon.\n\n\"Oh--nothing,\" answered Tom. \"I--I'll tell you later. Go on,\nplease.\"\n\n\"It is all so confusing,\" proceeded Mrs. Damon. \"You know my\nhusband has been in trouble of late--financial trouble?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded Tom, \"he mentioned it to me.\"\n\n\"I don't know any of the details,\" sighed Mrs. Damon, \"but I know\nhe was mixed up with a man named Peters.\"\n\n\"I know him, too,\" spoke Tom, grimly.\n\n\"My husband has been very gloomy of late,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"He\nfoolishly entrusted almost his entire fortune to that man, and\nlast night he told me it was probably all gone. He said he saw\nonly the barest chance to save it, but that he was going to take\nthat chance.\"\n\n\"Did he go into details?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"No, that was all he said. That was about ten o'clock. He didn't\nwant to go to bed. He just sat about, and he kept saying over and\nover again: 'Bless my tombstone!' 'Bless the cemetery!' and all\nsuch stuff as that. You know how he was,\" and she smiled through\nher tears.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"I know. Only it wasn't like him to bless such\ngrewsome things. He was more jolly.\"\n\n\"He hasn't been, of late,\" sighed his wife. \"Well, he sat about\nall the evening, and he kept figuring away, trying, I suppose, to\nfind some way out of his trouble.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he come to my father?\" cried Tom. \"I told him he could\nhave all the money he needed to tide him over.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Damon was queer that way,\" said his wife. \"He wanted to\nbe independent. I urged him to call you up, but he said he'd fight\nit out alone.\"\n\n\"As I said, we sat there, and he kept feeling more and more blue,\nand blessing his funeral, and the hearse and all such things as\nthat. He kept looking at the clock, too, and I wondered at that.\"\n\n\"'Are you expecting someone?' I asked him. He said he wasn't,\nexactly, but I made sure he was, and finally, about half-past\neleven, he put on his hat and went out.\"\n\n\"'Where are you going?' I asked him.\"\n\n\"'Oh, just to get a breath of air. I can't sleep,' he said. I\ndidn't think much of that, as he often used to go out and walk\nabout a bit before going to bed. So he went out, and I began to\nsee about locking up, for I never trust the servants.\"\n\n\"It must have been about an hour later when I heard voices out in\nfront. I looked, and I saw Mr. Damon talking to a man.\"\n\n\"Who was he?\" asked Tom, eagerly, on the alert for the slightest\nclue.\n\n\"I thought at the time,\" said Mrs. Damon, \"that it was one of the\nneighbors. I have learned since, however, that it was not. Anyhow,\nthis man and Mr. Damon stood talking for a little while, and then\nthey went off together. I didn't think it strange at the time,\nsupposing he was merely strolling up and down in front with Mr.\nBlackson, who lives next door, He often had done that before.\"\n\n\"Well, I saw that the house was locked up, and then I sat down in\na chair to wait for Mr. Damon to come back. I was getting sleepy,\nfor we don't usually stay up so late. I suppose I must have dozed\noff, but I was suddenly awakened by hearing a peculiar noise. I\nsat up in alarm, and then I realized that Mr. Damon had not come\nin.\"\n\n\"I was frightened then, and I called my maid. It was nearly one\no'clock, and my husband never stays out as late as that. We went\nnext door, and found that Mr. Blackson had not been out of his\nhouse that evening. So it could not have been he to whom Mr. Damon\nwas speaking.\"\n\n\"We roused up other neighbors, and they searched all about the\ngrounds, thinking he might have been overcome by a sudden faint.\nBut we could not find him. My husband had disappeared--mysteriously\ndisappeared!\" and the lady broke into sobs.\n\n\"Now don't worry,\" said Tom, soothingly, as he put his arms about\nher as he would have done to his own mother, had she been alive,\n\"We'll get him back!\"\n\n\"But how can you? No one knows where he is.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Tom, confidently, \"Mr. Damon himself knows where\nhe is, and unless he has gone away voluntarily, I think you will\nsoon hear from him.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by--voluntarily?\" asked the wife.\n\n\"First let me ask you a question,\" came from Tom. \"You said you\nwere awakened by a peculiar noise. What sort of a sound was it?\"\n\n\"Why, a whirring, throbbing noise, like--like--\"\n\nShe paused for a comparison.\n\n\"Like an airship?\" asked Tom, with a good deal of eagerness.\n\n\"That was it!\" cried Mrs. Damon. \"I was trying to think where I\nhad heard the sound before. It was just like the noise your\nairship makes, Tom!\"\n\n\"That settles it!\" exclaimed the young inventor.\n\n\"Settles what?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"The manner of Mr. Damon's disappearance. He was taken away--or\nwent away--in my airship--the airship that was stolen from my shed\nlast night!\"\n\nMrs. Damon stared at Tom in amazement.\n\n\"Why--why--how could that be?\" she asked.\n\nQuickly Tom told of what had happened at his place.\n\n\"I begin to see through it,\" he said. \"There is some plot here,\nand we've got to get to the bottom of it. Mr. Damon either went\nwith these men in the airship willingly, or he was taken away by\nforce. I'm inclined to think he went of his own accord, or you\nwould have heard some outcry, Mrs. Damon.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps so,\" she admitted. \"But would he go away in that\nmanner without telling me?\"\n\n\"He might,\" said Tom, willing to test his theory on all sides. \"He\nmight not have wanted you to worry, for you know you dislike him\nto go up an airships.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. Oh, if I only thought he did go away of his own\naccord, I could understand it. He went, if he did, to try and save\nhis fortune.\"\n\n\"It does look as though he had an appointment with someone, Tom,\"\nsuggested Ned. \"His looking at the clock, and then going out, and all\nthat.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the young inventor, \"and now I'm inclined to\nchange my theory a bit. It may have been some other airship than\nmine that was used.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"Because the men who took mine were unprincipled fellows. Mr.\nDamon would not have gone away with men who would steal an\nairship.\"\n\n\"Not if he knew it,\" admitted Ned. \"Well, then, let's consider two\nairships--yours and the other that came to keep the appointment\nwith Mr. Damon. If the last is true, why should he want to go away\nin an airship at midnight? Why couldn't he take a train, or an\nauto?\"\n\n\"Well, we don't know all the ins and outs,\" admitted Tom. \"Taking\na midnight airship ride is rather strange, but that may have been\nthe only course open. We'll have to let the explanation go until\nlater. At any rate, Mrs. Damon, I feel sure that your husband did\ngo off through the air--either in my Eagle or in some other\ncraft.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so, Tom Swift, though it sounds a\ndreadful thing to say. But if he did go off of his own accord, I\nknow he did it for the best. And he may not have told me, for fear\nI would worry. I can understand that. But why isn't he back now?\"\n\nTom had been rather dreading that question. It was one he had\nasked himself, and he had found no good answer for it. If there\nhad been such need of haste, that an airship had to be used, why\nhad not Mr. Damon come back ere this? Unless, as Tom feared to\nadmit, even to himself, there had been some accident.\n\nHalf a dozen theories flashed through his mind, but he could not\nselect a good, working one,--particularly as there were no clues.\nDisappearing in an airship was the one best means of not leaving a\ntrace behind. An auto, a motor boat, a train, a horse and\ncarriage--all these could be more or less easily traced. But an\nairship--\n\nIf Mr. Damon wanted to cover up his tracks, or if he had been\ntaken away, and his captors wanted to baffle pursuit, the best\nmeans had been adopted.\n\n\"Now don't you worry,\" advised Tom to Mrs. Damon. \"I know it looks\nfunny, but I think it will come out all right. Ned and I will do\nall we can. Mr. Damon must have known what he was about. But, to\nbe on the safe side, we'll send out a general alarm through the\npolice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know what I'd done if you hadn't come to help me!\"\nexclaimed Mrs. Damon.\n\n\"Just you leave it to me!\" said the young inventor, cheerfully.\n\"I'll find Mr. Damon!\"\n\nBut, though he spoke thus confidently, Tom Swift had not the\nslightest notion, just then, of how to set about his difficult\ntask. He had had hard problems to solve before, so he was not\ngoing to give up this one. First he wanted to think matters out,\nand arrange a plan of action.\n\nHe and Ned made a careful examination of the grounds of the Damon\nhomestead. There was little they could learn, though they did find\nwhere an airship had landed in a meadow, not far away, and where\nit had made a flying start off again.\n\nCarefully Tom looked at the marks made by the wheels of the\nairship.\n\n\"They're the same distance apart as those on the Eagle,\" he said\nto his chum, \"and the tires are the same. But that isn't saying\nanything, as lots of airships have the same equipment. So we won't\njump to any conclusions that way.\"\n\nTom and Ned interviewed several of the neighbors, but beyond\nlearning that some of them had heard the throbbing of the midnight\nairship, that was as far as they got on that line.\n\nThere was nothing more they could do in Waterford, and, leaving\nMrs. Damon, who had summoned a relative to stay with her, the two\nchums made a quick trip back through the air to Shopton. As\nEradicate came out to help put away the monoplane Tom noticed that\nthe colored man was holding one hand as though it hurt him.\n\n\"What's the matter, Rad?\" asked the young investor.\n\n\"Oh, nuffin--jest natcherly nuffin, Massa Tom.\"\n\nBut Eradicate spoke evasively and in a manner that roused Tom's\nsuspicions.\n\n\"Boomerang, your mule, didn't kick you; did he?\"\n\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom, no sah. 'Twern't nuffin laik dat.\"\n\n\"But what was it? Your hand is hurt!\"\n\n\"Well, Massa Tom, I s'pose I done bettah tell yo' all. I'se had a\nshock!\"\n\n\"A shock?\"\n\n\"Yas, sah. A shock. A lickrish shock.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean an electrical shock. That's too bad. I suppose you\nmust have touched a live wire.\"\n\n\"No, sah. 'Twern't dat way.\"\n\n\"How was it, then?\"\n\n\"Well, yo' see, Massa Tom, I were playin' a joke on Koku.\"\n\n\"Oh, you were; eh? Then I suppose Koku shocked you,\" laughed Tom.\n\n\"No, sah. I--I'll tell you. Dat giant man he were in de telefoam\nboof in de pattern shop--you know--de one where yo' all been\ntryin' to make pishures.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. Go on!\" exclaimed Tom, impatiently.\n\n\"Well, he were in dere, Massa Tom, an' I slipped into de boof in\nde next shop--de odder place where yo' all been 'speermentin'. I\ncalled out on de telefoam, loud laik de Angel Gabriel gwine t'\nholler at de last trump: 'Look out, yo' ole sinnah!' I yell it\njest t' scare Koku.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Tom, a bit severely, for he did not like Eradicate\ninterfering with the instruments. \"And did you scare Koku?\"\n\n\"Oh, yas, sah, Massa Tom. I skeered him all right; but suffin else\ndone happen. When I put down de telefoam I got a terrible shock.\nIt hurts yit!\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, \"I suppose I ought to feel sorry for you,\nbut I can't. You should let things alone. Now I've got to see if\nyou did any damage. Come along, Ned.\"\n\nTom was the first to enter the telephone booth where Eradicate had\nplayed the part of the Angel Gabriel. He looked at the wires and\napparatus, but could see nothing wrong.\n\nThen he glanced at the selenium plate, on which he hoped, some\nday, to imprint an image from over the wire. And, as he saw the\nsmooth surface he started, and cried.\n\n\"Ned! Ned, come here quick!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked his chum, crowding into the booth.\n\n\"Look at that plate! Tell me what you see!\"\n\nNed looked.\n\n\"Why--why it's Koku's picture!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Exactly!\" cried Tom. \"In some way my experiment has succeeded\nwhen I was away. Eradicate must have made some new connection by\nhis monkeying. Ned, it's a success! I've got my first photo\ntelephone picture! Hurray!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMAKING IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\nTom Swift was so overjoyed and excited that for a few moments he\ncapered about, inside the booth, and outside, knocking against his\nchum Ned, clapping him on the back, and doing all manner of boyish\n\"stunts.\"\n\n\"It's a success, Ned! I've struck it!\" cried Tom, in delight.\n\n\"Ouch! You struck ME, you mean!\" replied Ned, rubbing his\nshoulder, where the young inventor had imparted a resounding blow\nof joy.\n\n\"What of it?\" exclaimed Tom. \"My apparatus works! I can send a\npicture by telephone! It's great, Ned!\"\n\n\"But I don't exactly understand how it happened,\" said Ned, in\nsome bewilderment, as he gazed at the selenium plate.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" admitted Tom, when he had somewhat calmed down.\n\"That is, I don't exactly understand what made the thing succeed\nnow, when it wouldn't work for me a little while ago. But I've got\nto go into that. I'll have to interview that rascal Eradicate, and\nlearn what he did when he played that trick on Koku. Yes, and I'll\nhave to see Koku, too. We've got to get at the bottom of this,\nNed.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. You've got your hands full, Tom, with your photo\ntelephone, and the disappearance of Mr. Damon.\"\n\n\"Yes, and my own airship, too. I must get after that. Whew! A lot\nof things to do! But I like work, Ned. The more the better.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's like you, Tom. But what are you going to get at\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Let me see; the telephone, I think. I'll have Rad and Koku in\nhere and talk to them. I say, you Eradicate!\" he called out of the\ndoor of the shop, as he saw the colored man going past, holding\nhis shocked arm tenderly.\n\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom, I'se comin'! What is it yo' all wants, Massa\nTom?\"\n\n\"I want you to show me exactly what you did to the wires, and\nother things in here, when you played that Angel Gabriel trick on\nyour partner Koku.\"\n\n\"Partner! He ain't mah partner!\" exclaimed Eradicate with a scowl,\nfor there was not the best of feeling between the two. Eradicate\nhad served in the Swift family many years, and he rather resented\nthe coming of the giant, who performed many services formerly the\nprovince of the colored man.\n\n\"Well, never mind what he is, Rad,\" laughed Tom. \"You just show me\nwhat you did. Come now, something happened in here, and I want to\nfind out what it was.\"\n\n\"Oh, suffin done happened all right, Massa Tom. Yas, sah! Suffin\ndone happened!\" cried Eradicate, with such odd emphasis that Tom\nand Ned both laughed.\n\n\"An' suffin happened to me,\" went on the colored man, rubbing his\nshocked arm.\n\n\"Well, tell us about it,\" suggested Tom.\n\n\"It was dish yeah way,\" proceeded Eradicate. And he told more in\ndetail how, seeing Koku cleaning and sweeping out the other\ntelephone booth, he had thought of the trick to play on him. Both\ntelephones had what are called \"amplifiers\" attached, that could\nbe switched on when needed. These amplifiers were somewhat like\nthe horn of a phonograph--they increased, or magnified the sound,\nso that one could hear a voice from any part of the shop, and need\nnot necessarily have the telephone receiver at his ear.\n\nSeeing Koku near the instrument, Eradicate had switched on the\namplifier, and had called into his instrument, trying to scare the\ngiant. And he did startle Koku, for the loud voice, coming so\nsuddenly, sent the giant out of the booth on the run.\n\n\"But you must have done something else,\" insisted Tom. \"Look here,\nRad,\" and the young inventor pointed to the picture on the plate.\n\n\"Mah gracious sakes!\" gasped the colored man. \"Why dat's Koku\nhisse'f!\" and he looked in awe at the likeness.\n\n\"That's what you did, Rad!\"\n\n\"Me? I done dat? No, sah, Massa Tom. I neber did! No, sah!\"\nEradicate spoke emphatically.\n\n\"Yes you did, Rad. You took that picture of Koku over my photo\ntelephone, and I want you to show me exactly what you did--what\nwires and switches you touched and changed, and all that.\"\n\n\"Yo--yo' done say I tuck dat pishure, Massa Tom?\"\n\n\"You sure did, Rad.\"\n\n\"Well--well, good land o' massy! An' I done dat!\"\n\nEradicate stared in wonder at the image of the giant on the plate,\nand shook his head doubtingly.\n\n\"I--I didn't know I could do it. I never knowed I had it in me!\"\nhe murmured.\n\nTom and Ned laughed long and loud, and then the young inventor\nsaid:\n\n\"Now look here, Rad. You've done me a mighty big service, though\nyou didn't know it, and I want to thank you. I'm sorry about your\narm, and I'll have the doctor look at it. But now I want you to\nshow me all the things you touched when you played that joke on\nKoku. In some way you did what I haven't been able to do, You took\nthe picture. There's probably just one little thing I've\noverlooked, and you stumbled on it by accident. Now go ahead and\nshow me.\"\n\nEradicate thought for a moment, and then said:\n\n\"Well, I done turned on de current, laik I seen you done, Massa\nTom.\"\n\n\"Yes, go on. You connected the telephone.\"\n\n\"Yas, sah. Den I switched on that flyer thing yo' all has rigged\nup.\"\n\n\"You switched on the amplifier, yes. Go on.\"\n\n\"An'--an' den I plugged in dish year wire,\" and the colored man\npointed to one near the top of the booth.\n\n\"You switched on that wire, Rad! Why, great Scott, man! That's\nconnected to the arc light circuit--it carries over a thousand\nvolts. And you switched that into the telephone circuit?\"\n\n\"Dat's what I done did, Massa Tom; yas, sah!\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Why, I done want t' make mah voice good an' loud t' skeer dat\nrascal Koku!\"\n\nTom stared at the colored man in amazement.\n\n\"No wonder you got a shock!\" exclaimed the young inventor. \"You\ndidn't get all the thousand volts, for part of it was shunted off;\nbut you got a good charge, all right. So that's what did the\nbusiness; eh? It was the combination of the two electrical\ncircuits that sent the photograph over the wire.\"\n\n\"I understand it now, Rad; but you did more than I've been able to\ndo. I never, in a hundred years, would have thought of switching\non that current. It never occurred to me. But you, doing it by\naccident, brought out the truth. It's often that way in\ndiscoveries. And Koku was standing in the other telephone booth,\nnear the plate there, when you switched in this current, Rad?\"\n\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom. He were. An' yo' ought t' see him hop when\nhe heard mah voice yellin' at him. Ha! ha! ha!\"\n\nEradicate chuckled at the thought. Then a pain in his shocked arm\nmade him wince. A wry look passed over his face.\n\n\"Yas, sah, Koku done jump about ten feet,\" he said. \"An'--an' den\nI jump too. Ain't no use in denyin' dat fact. I done jump when I\ngot dat shock!\"\n\n\"All right, Rad. You may go now. I think I'm on the right track!\"\nexclaimed Tom. \"Come on, Ned, we'll try some experiments, and\nwe'll see what we can do.\"\n\n\"No shocks though--cut out the shocks, Tom,\" stipulated his chum.\n\n\"Oh, sure! No shocks! Now crowding busy and improve on\nEradicate's Angel Gabriel system.\"\n\nTom made a quick examination of the apparatus.\n\n\"I understand it, I think,\" he said. \"Koku was near the plate in\nthe other booth when Rad put on the double current. There was a\nlight there, and in an instant his likeness was sent over the\nwire, and imprinted on this plate. Now let's see what we can do.\nYou go to that other booth, Ned. I'll see if I can get your\npicture, and send you mine. Here, take some extra selenium plates\nalong. You know how to connect them.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Ned.\n\n\"This image is really too faint to be of much use,\" went on Tom,\nas he looked at the one of Koku. \"I think I can improve on it. But\nwe're on the right track.\"\n\nA little later Ned stood in the other booth, while Tom arranged\nthe wires, and made the connections in the way accidently\ndiscovered by Eradicate. The young inventor had put in a new\nplate, carefully putting away the one with the picture of the\ngiant, This plate could be used again, when the film, into which\nthe image was imprinted, had been washed off.\n\n\"All ready, Ned,\" called Tom, over the wire, when he was about to\nturn the switch. \"Stand still, and I'll get you.\"\n\nThe connection was made, and Tom uttered a cry of joy. For there,\nstaring at him from the plate in front of him was the face of Ned.\n\nIt was somewhat reduced in size, of course, and was not extra\nclear, but anyone who knew Ned could have told he was at the other\nend of the wire.\n\n\"Do you get me, Tom?\" called Ned, over the telephone.\n\n\"I sure do! Now see if you can get me.\"\n\nTom made other connections, and then looked at the sending plate\nof his instrument, there being both a sending and receiving plate\nin each booth, just as there was a receiver and a transmitter to\nthe telephone.\n\n\"Hurray! I see you, Tom!\" cried Ned, over the wire. \"Say, this is\ngreat!\"\n\n\"It isn't as good as I want it,\" went on Tom. \"But it proves that\nI'm right. The photo telephone is a fact, and now persons using\nthe wire can be sure of the other person they are conversing with.\nI must tell dad. He wouldn't believe I could do it!\"\n\nAnd indeed Mr. Swift was surprised when Tom proved, by actual\ndemonstration, that a picture could be sent over the wire.\n\n\"Tom, I congratulate you!\" declared the aged inventor. \"It is good\nnews!\"\n\n\"Yes, but we have bad news of Mr. Damon,\" said Tom, and he told\nhis father of the disappearance of the eccentric man. Mr. Swift at\nonce telephoned his sympathy to Mrs. Damon, and offered to do\nanything he could for her.\n\n\"But Tom can help you more than I can,\" he said. \"You can depend\non Tom.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" replied Mrs. Damon, over the wire.\n\nAnd certainly Tom Swift had many things to do now. He hardly knew\nat what to begin first, but now, since he was on the right road in\nregard to his photo telephone, he would work at improving it.\n\nAnd to this end he devoted himself, after he had sent out a\ngeneral alarm to the police of nearby towns, in regard to the\ndisappearance of Mr. Damon. The airship clue, he believed, as did\nthe police, would be a good one to work on.\n\nFor several days after this nothing of moment occurred. Mr. Damon\ncould not be located, and Tom's airship might still be sailing\nabove the clouds as far as getting any trace of it was concerned.\n\nMeanwhile the young inventor, with the help of Ned, who was given\na leave of absence from the bank, worked hard to improve the photo\ntelephone.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE AIRSHIP CLUE\n\n\n\"Now Ned, we'll try again. I'm going to use a still stronger\ncurrent, and this is the most sensitive selenium plate I've turned\nout yet. We'll see if we can't get a better likeness of you--one\nthat will be plainer.\"\n\nIt was Tom Swift who was speaking, and he and his chum had just\ncompleted some hard work on the new photo telephone. Though the\napparatus did what Tom had claimed for it, still he was far from\nsatisfied. He could transmit over the wire the picture of a person\ntalking at the telephone, but the likeness was too faint to make\nthe apparatus commercially profitable.\n\n\"It's like the first moving pictures,\" said Tom. \"They moved, but\nthat was about all they did.\"\n\n\"I say,\" remarked Ned, as he was about to take his place in the\nbooth where the telephone and apparatus were located, \"this\ndouble-strength electrical current you're speaking of won't shock\nme; will it? I don't want what happened to Eradicate to happen to\nme, Tom.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. Nothing will happen. The trouble with Rad was that\nhe didn't have the wires insulated when he turned that arc current\nswitch by mistake--or, rather, to play his joke. But he's all\nright now.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I'm not going to take any chances,\" insisted Ned. \"I\nwant to be insulated myself.\"\n\n\"I'll see to that,\" promised Tom. \"Now get to your booth.\"\n\nFor the purpose of experiments Tom had strung a new line between\ntwo of his shops, They were both within sight, and the line was\nnot very long; but, as I have said, Tom knew that if his apparatus\nwould work over a short distance, it would also be successful over\na long one, provided he could maintain the proper force of\ncurrent, which he was sure could be accomplished.\n\n\"And if they can send pictures from Monte Carlo to Paris I can do\nthe same,\" declared Tom, though his system of photo telephony was\ndifferent from sending by a telegraph system--a reproduction of a\npicture on a copper plate. Tom's apparatus transmitted the\nlikeness of the living person.\n\nIt took some little time for the young inventor, and Ned working\nwith him, to fix up the new wires and switch on the current. But\nat last it was complete, and Ned took his place at one telephone,\nwith the two sensitive plates before him. Tom did the same, and\nthey proceeded to talk over the wire, first making sure that the\nvocal connection was perfect.\n\n\"All ready now, Ned! We'll try it,\" called Tom to his chum, over\nthe wire. \"Look straight at the plate. I want to get your image\nfirst, and then I'll send mine, if it's a success.\"\n\nNed did as requested, and in a few minutes he could hear Tom\nexclaim, joyfully:\n\n\"It's better, Ned! It's coming out real clear. I can see you\nalmost as plainly as if you were right in the booth with me. But\nturn on your light a little stronger.\"\n\nTom could hear, through the telephone, his chum moving about, and\nthen he caught a startled exclamation.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Tom anxiously.\n\n\"I got a shock!\" cried Ned. \"I thought you said you had this thing\nfixed. Great Scott, Tom! It nearly yanked the arm off me! Is this\na joke?\"\n\n\"No, old man. No, of course not! Something must be wrong. I didn't\nmean that. Wait, I'll take a look. Say, it does seem as if\neverything was going wrong with this invention. But I'm on the\nright track, and soon I'll have it all right. Wait a second. I'll\nbe right over.\"\n\nTom found that it was only a simple displacement of a wire that\nhad given Ned a shock, and he soon had this remedied.\n\n\"Now we'll try again,\" he said. This time nothing wrong occurred,\nand soon Tom saw the clearest image he had yet observed on his\ntelephone photo plate.\n\n\"Switch me on now, Ned,\" he called to his chum, and Ned reported\nthat he could see Tom very plainly.\n\n\"So far--so good,\" observed Tom, as he came from the booth. \"But\nthere are several things I want yet to do.\"\n\n\"Such as what?\" questioned Ned.\n\n\"Well, I want to arrange to have two kinds of pictures come over\nthe wire. I want it so that a person can go into a booth, call up\na friend, and then switch on the picture plate, so he can see his\nfriend as well as talk to him. I want this plate to be like a\nmirror, so that any number of images can be made to appear on it.\nIn that way it can be used over and over again. In fact it will be\nexactly like a mirror, or a telescope. No matter how far two\npersons may be apart they can both see and talk to one another.\"\n\n\"That's a big contract, Tom.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you've seen that it can be done. Then another thing I\nwant to do is to have it arranged so that I can make a photograph\nof a person over a wire.\"\n\n\"Meaning what?\"\n\n\"Meaning that if a certain person talks to me over the wire, I can\nturn my switch, and get a picture of him here at my apparatus\nconnected with my telephone. To do that I'll merely need a sending\napparatus at the other end of the telephone line--not a receiving\nmachine.\"\n\n\"Could you arrange it so that the person who was talking to you\nwould have his picture taken whether he wanted it or not?\" asked\nNed.\n\n\"Yes, it might be done,\" spoke Tom, thoughtfully. \"I could conceal\nthe sending plate somewhere in the telephone booth, and arrange\nthe proper light, I suppose.\"\n\n\"That might be a good way in which to catch a criminal,\" went on\nNed. \"Often crooks call up on the telephone, but they know they\nare safe. The authorities can't see them--they can only hear them.\nNow if you could get a photograph of them while they were\ntelephoning--\"\n\n\"I see!\" cried Tom, excitedly. \"That's a great idea! I'll work on\nthat, Ned.\"\n\nAnd, all enthusiasm, Tom began to plan new schemes with his photo\ntelephone.\n\nThe young inventor did not forget his promise to help Mrs. Damon.\nBut he could get absolutely no clue to her husband's whereabouts.\nMr. Damon had completely and mysteriously disappeared. His\nfortune, too, seemed to have been swallowed up by the sharpers,\nthough lawyers engaged by Tom could fasten no criminal acts on Mr.\nPeters, who indignantly denied that he had done anything unlawful.\n\nIf he had, he had done it in such a way that he could not be\nbrought to justice. The promoter was still about Shopton, as well\ngroomed as ever, with his rose in his buttonhole, and wearing his\nsilk hat. He still speeded up and down Lake Carlopa in his\npowerful motor boat. But he gave Tom Swift a wide berth.\n\nLate one night, when Tom and Ned had been working at the new photo\ntelephone, after all the rest of the household had retired, Tom\nsuddenly looked up from his drawings and exclaimed:\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"What's what?\" inquired Ned.\n\n\"That sound? Don't you hear it? Listen!\"\n\n\"It's an airship--maybe yours coming back!\" cried the young\nbanker.\n\nAs he spoke Ned did hear, seemingly in the air above the house, a\ncurious, throbbing, pulsating sound.\n\n\"That's so! It is an airship motor!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Come on out!\"\n\nTogether they rushed from the house, but, ere they reached the\nyard, the sound had ceased. They looked up into the sky, but could\nsee nothing, though the night was light from a full moon.\n\n\"I certainly heard it,\" said Tom.\n\n\"So did I,\" asserted Ned. \"But where is it now?\"\n\nThey advanced toward the group of work-buildings. Something\nshowing white in the moonlight, before the hangar, caught Ned's\neyes.\n\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed. \"There's an airship, Tom!\"\n\nThe two rushed over to the level landing place before the big\nshed. And there, as if she had just been run out for a flight, was\nthe Eagle. She had come back in the night, as mysteriously as she\nhad been taken away.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nSUCCESS\n\n\n\"Well, this gets me!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\n\"It sure is strange,\" agreed Ned. \"How did she come here?\"\n\n\"She didn't come alone--that's sure,\" went on Tom. \"Someone\nbrought her here, made a landing, and got away before we could get\nout.\"\n\nThe two chums were standing near the Eagle, which had come back so\nmysteriously.\n\n\"Just a couple of seconds sooner and we'd have seen who brought\nher here,\" went on Tom. \"But they must have shut off the motor\nsome distance up, and then they volplaned down. That's why we\ndidn't hear them.\"\n\nNed went over and put his hand on the motor.\n\n\"Ouch!\" he cried, jumping back. \"It's hot!\"\n\n\"Showing that she's been running up to within a few minutes ago,\"\nsaid Tom. \"Well, as I said before, this sure does get me. First\nthese mysterious men take my airship, and then they bring her back\nagain, without so much as thanking me for the use of her.\"\n\n\"Who in the world can they be?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"I haven't the least idea. But I'm going to find out, if it's at\nall possible. We'll look the machine over in the morning, and see\nif we can get any clues. No use in doing that now. Come on, we'll\nput her back in the hangar.\"\n\n\"Say!\" exclaimed Ned, as a sudden idea came to him. \"It couldn't\nbe Mr. Damon who had your airship; could it, Tom?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Why do you ask that?\"\n\n\"Well, he might have wanted to get away from his enemies for a\nwhile, and he might have taken your Eagle, and--\"\n\n\"Mr. Damon wouldn't trail along with a crowd like the one that\ntook away my airship,\" said Tom, decidedly. \"You've got another\nguess coming, Ned. Mr. Damon had nothing to do with this.\"\n\n\"And yet the night he disappeared an airship was heard near his\nhouse.\"\n\n\"That's so. Well, I give up. This is sure a mystery. We'll have a\nlook at it in the morning. One thing I'll do, though, I'll\ntelephone over to Mr. Damon's house and see if his wife has heard\nany news. I've been doing that quite often of late, so she won't\nthink anything of it. In that way we can find out if he had\nanything to do with my airship. But let's run her into the shed\nfirst.\"\n\nThis was done, and Koku, the giant, was sent to sleep in the\nhangar to guard against another theft. But it was not likely that\nthe mysterious men, once having brought the airship back, would\ncome for it again.\n\nTom called up Mrs. Damon on the telephone, but there was no news\nof the missing man. He expressed his sympathy, and said he would\ncome and see her soon. He told Mrs. Damon not to get discouraged,\nadding that he, and others, were doing all that was possible. But,\nin spite of this, Mrs. Damon, naturally, did worry.\n\nThe next morning the two chums inspected the airship, so\nmysteriously returned to them. Part after part they went over, and\nfound nothing wrong. The motor ran perfectly, and there was not so\nmuch as a bent spoke in the landing wheels. For all that could be\ntold by an inspection of the craft she might never have been out\nof the hangar.\n\n\"Hello, here's something!\" cried Tom, as he got up from the\noperator's seat, where he had taken his place to test the various\ncontrols.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"A button. A queer sort of a button. I never had any like that on\nmy clothes, and I'm sure you didn't. Look!\" and Tom held out a\nlarge, metal button of curious design.\n\n\"It must have come off the coat of one of the men who had your\nairship, Tom,\" said his chum. \"Save it. You may find that it's a\nclue.\"\n\n\"I will. No telling what it may lead to. Well, I guess that's all\nwe can find.\"\n\nAnd it was. But Tom little realized what a clue the button was\ngoing to be. Nothing more could be learned by staring at the\nreturned airship, so he and Ned went back to the house.\n\nTom Swift had many things to do, but his chief concern was for the\nphoto telephone. Now that he was near the goal of success he\nworked harder than ever. The idea Ned had given him of being able\nto take the picture of a person at the instrument--without the\nknowledge of that person--appealed strongly to Tom.\n\n\"That's going to be a valuable invention!\" he declared, but little\nhe knew how valuable it would prove to him and to others.\n\nIt was about a week later when Tom was ready to try the new\napparatus. Meanwhile he had prepared different plates, and had\nchanged his wiring system. In the days that had passed nothing new\nhad been learned concerning the whereabouts of Mr. Damon, nor of\nthe men who had so mysteriously taken away Tom's airship.\n\nAll was in readiness for the trial. Tom sent Ned to the booth that\nhe had constructed in the airship hangar, some distance away from\nthe house. The other booth Tom had placed in his library, an\nentirely new system of wires being used.\n\n\"Now Ned,\" explained Tom, \"the idea is this! You go into that\nbooth, just as if it were a public one, and ring me up in the\nregular way. Of course we haven't a central here, but that doesn't\nmatter. Now while I'm talking to you I want to see you. You don't\nknow that, of course.\"\n\n\"The point is to see if I can get your picture while you're\ntalking to me, and not let you know a thing about it.\"\n\n\"Think you can do it, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try. We'll soon know. Go ahead.\"\n\nA little later Ned was calling up his chum, as casually as he\ncould, under the circumstances.\n\n\"All right!\" called Tom to his chum. \"Start in and talk. Say\nanything you like--it doesn't matter. I want to see if I can get\nyour picture. Is the light burning in your booth?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom.\"\n\n\"All right then. Go ahead.\"\n\nNed talked of the weather--of anything. Meanwhile Tom was busy.\nConcealed in the booth occupied by Ned was a sending plate. It\ncould not be seen unless one knew just where to look for it. In\nTom's booth was a receiving plate.\n\nThe experiment did not take long. Presently Tom called to Ned that\nhe need stay there no longer.\n\n\"Come on to the house,\" invited the young inventor, \"and we'll\ndevelope this plate.\" For in this system it was necessary to\ndevelope the receiving plate, as is done with an ordinary\nphotographic one. Tom wanted a permanent record.\n\nEagerly the chums in the dark room looked down into the tray\ncontaining the plate and the developing solution.\n\n\"Something's coming out!\" cried Ned, eagerly.\n\n\"Yes! And it's you!\" exclaimed Tom. \"See, Ned, I got your picture\nover the telephone. Success! I've struck it! This is the best\nyet!\"\n\nAt that moment, as the picture came out more and more plainly,\nsomeone knocked on the door of the dark room.\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Gen'man t' see you,\" said Eradicate. \"He say he come from Mistah\nPeters!\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters--that rascally promoter!\" whispered Tom to his chum.\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE\n\n\nTom Swift and his chum looked at one another strangely for a\nmoment in the dim, red light of the dark room. Then the young\ninventor spoke:\n\n\"I'm not going to see him. Tell him so, Rad!\"\n\n\"Hold on a second,\" suggested Ned. \"Maybe you had better see him,\nTom. It may have something to with Mr. Damon's lost fortune.\"\n\n\"That's so! I didn't think of that. And I may get a clue to his\ndisappearance, though I don't imagine Peters had anything to do\nwith that. Wait, Rad. Tell the gentleman I'll see him. Did he give\nany name, Rad?\"\n\n\"Yas, sah. Him done say him Mistah Boylan.\"\n\n\"The same man who called to see me once before, trying to get me\nto do some business with Peters,\" murmured Tom. \"Very well, I'll\nsee him as soon as this picture is fixed. Tell him to wait, Rad.\"\n\nA little later Tom went to where his caller awaited in the\nlibrary. This time there were no plans to be looked at, the young\ninventor having made a practice of keeping all his valuable papers\nlocked in a safe.\n\n\"You go into the next room, Ned,\" Tom had said to his chum. \"Leave\nthe door open, so you can hear what is said.\"\n\n\"Why, do you think there'll be trouble? Maybe we'd better have\nKoku on hand to--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, nothing like that,\" laughed Tom. \"I just want you to\nlisten to what's said so, if need be, you can be a witness later.\nI don't know what their game is, but I don't trust Peters and his\ncrowd. They may want to get control of some of my patents, and\nthey may try some underhanded work. If they do I want to be in a\nposition to stop them.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Ned, and he took his place.\n\nBut Mr. Boylan's errand was not at all sensational, it would seem.\nHe bowed to Tom, perhaps a little distantly, for they had not\nparted the best of friends on a former occasion.\n\n\"I suppose you are surprised to see me,\" began Mr. Boylan.\n\n\"Well, I am, to tell the truth,\" Tom said, calmly.\n\n\"I am here at the request of my employer, Mr. Peters,\" went on the\ncaller. \"He says he is forming a new and very powerful company to\nexploit airships, and he wants to know whether you would not\nreconsider your determination not to let him do some business for\nyou.\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid I don't care to go into anything like that,\" said\nTom.\n\n\"It would be a good thing for you,\" proceeded Mr. Boylan, eagerly.\n\"Mr. Peters is able to command large capital, and if you would\npermit the use of your airships--or one of them--as a model, and\nwould supervise the construction of others, we could confidently\nexpect large sales. Thus you would profit, and I am frank to admit\nthat the company, and Mr. Peters, also, would make money. Mr.\nPeters is perfectly free to confess that he is in business to make\nmoney, but he is also willing to let others share with him. Come\nnow, what do you say?\"\n\n\"I am sorry, but I shall have to say the same thing I said\nbefore,\" replied Tom. \"Nothing doing!\"\n\nMr. Boylan glanced rather angrily at the young inventor, and then,\nwith a shrug of his shoulders, remarked:\n\n\"Well, you have the say, of course. But I would like to remind you\nthat this is going to be a very large airship company, and if your\ninventions are not exploited some others will be. And Mr. Peters\nalso desired me to say that this is the last offer he would make\nyou.\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Tom, \"that I am much obliged, but that I have no\nbusiness that I can entrust to him. If he wishes to make some\nother type of airship, that is his affair. Good-day.\"\n\nAs Mr. Boylan was going out Tom noticed a button dangling from the\nback of his caller's coat. It hung by a thread, being one of the\npair usually sewed on the back of a cutaway garment.\n\n\"I think you had better take off that button before it falls,\"\nsuggested Tom. \"You may lose it, and perhaps it would be hard to\nmatch.\"\n\n\"That's so. Thank you!\" said Mr. Boylan. He tried to reach around\nand get it, but he was too stout to turn easily, especially as the\ncoat was tight-fitting.\n\n\"I'll get it for you,\" offered Tom, as he pulled it off. \"There is\none missing, though,\" he said, as he handed the button to the man.\nAnd then Tom started as he saw the pattern of the one in his hand.\n\n\"One gone? That's too bad,\" murmured Mr. Boylan. \"Those buttons\nwere imported, and I doubt if I can replace them. They are rather\nodd.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tom, gazing as if fascinated at the one he still\nheld. \"They are rather odd.\"\n\nAnd then, as he passed it over, like a flash it came to him where\nhe had seen a button like that before. He had found it in his\nairship, which had been so mysteriously taken away and returned.\n\nTom could hardly restrain his impatience until Mr. Boylan had\ngone. The young inventor had half a notion to produce the other\nbutton, matching the one he had just pulled off his visitor's\ncoat, and tell where he had found it. But he held himself back. He\nwanted to talk first to Ned.\n\nAnd, when his chum came in, Tom cried:\n\n\"Ned, what do you think? I know who had my airship!\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Ned, in wonder.\n\n\"By that button clue! Yes, it's the same kind--they're as alike as\ntwins!\" and Tom brought out the button which he had put away in\nhis desk. \"See, Boylan had one just like this on the back of his\ncoat. The other was missing. Here it is--it was in the seat of my\nairship, where it was probably pulled off as he moved about. Ned,\nI think I've got the right clue at last.\"\n\nNed said nothing for several seconds. Then he remarked slowly:\n\n\"Well, Tom, it proves one thing; but not the other.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that it may be perfectly true that the button came off Mr.\nBoylan's coat, but that doesn't prove that he wore it. You can be\nreasonably sure that the coat was having a ride in your Eagle, but\nwas Boylan in the coat? That's the question.\"\n\n\"In the coat? Of course he was in it!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"You can't be sure. Someone may have borrowed his coat to take a\nmidnight ride in the airship.\"\n\n\"Mr. Boylan doesn't look to be the kind of a man who would lend\nhis clothes,\" remarked Tom.\n\n\"You never can tell. Someone may have borrowed it without his\nknowledge. You'd better go a bit slow, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe I had. But it's a clue, anyhow.\"\n\nNed agreed to this.\n\n\"And all I've got to do is to find out who was in the coat when it\nwas riding about in my airship,\" went on Tom.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ned, \"and then maybe you'll have some clue to the\ndisappearance of Mr. Damon.\"\n\n\"Right you are! Come on, let's get busy!\"\n\n\"As if we hadn't been busy all the while!\" laughed Ned. \"I'll lose\nmy place at the bank if I don't get back soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, stay a little longer--a few days,\" urged Tom. \"I'm sure that\nsomething is going to happen soon. Anyhow my photo telephone is\nabout perfected. But I've just thought of another improvement.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I'm going to arrange a sort of dictaphone, or phonograph, so I\ncan get a permanent record of what a person says over the wire, as\nwell as get a picture of him saying it. Then everything will be\ncomplete. This last won't be hard to do, as there are several\nmachines on the market now, for preserving a record of telephone\nconversations. I'll make mine a bit different, though.\"\n\n\"Tom, is there any limit to what you're going to do?\" asked Ned,\nadmiringly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'm going to stop soon, and retire,\" laughed the young\ninventor.\n\nAfter talking the matter over, Tom and his chum decided to wait a\nday or so before taking any action in regard to the button clue to\nthe takers of the airship. After all, no great harm had been done,\nand Tom was more anxious to locate Mr. Damon, and try to get back\nhis fortune, as well as to perfect his photo telephone, than he\nwas to discover those who had helped themselves to the Eagle.\n\nTom and Ned put in some busy days, arranging the phonograph\nattachment. It was easy, compared to the hard work of sending a\npicture over the wire. They paid several visits to Mrs. Damon, but\nshe had no news of her missing husband, and, as the days went by,\nshe suffered more and more under the strain.\n\nFinally Tom's new invention was fully completed. It was a great\nsuccess, and he not only secured pictures of Ned and others over\nthe wire, as he talked to them, but he imprinted on wax cylinders,\nto be reproduced later, the very things they said.\n\nIt was a day or so after he had demonstrated his new attachment\nfor the first time, that Tom received a most urgent message from\nMrs. Damon.\n\n\"Tom,\" she said, over the telephone, \"I wish you would call.\nSomething very mysterious has happened.\"\n\n\"Mr. Damon hasn't come back; has he?\" asked Tom eagerly.\n\n\"No--but I wish I could say he had. This concerns him, however.\nCan you come?\"\n\n\"I'll be there right away.\"\n\nIn his speedy monoplane Tom soon reached Waterford. Ned did not\naccompany him this time.\n\n\"Now what is it, Mrs. Damon?\" asked the young inventor.\n\n\"About half an hour before I called you,\" she said, \"I received a\nmysterious message.\"\n\n\"Who brought it?\" asked Tom quickly.\n\n\"No one. It came over the telephone. Someone, whose voice I did\nnot know, said to me: 'Sign the land papers, and send them to us,\nand your husband will be released.'\"\n\n\"That message came over the wire?\" cried Tom, excitedly.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"Oh, I am so frightened! I don't know\nwhat to do!\" and the lady burst into tears.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nANOTHER CALL\n\n\nTom Swift, for the moment, did not know what to do. It was a\nstrange situation, and one he had never thought of. What did the\nmysterious message mean? He must think it all out, and plan some\nline of action. Clearly Mrs. Damon was not able to do so.\n\n\"Now let's get at this in some kind of order,\" suggested the\nyouth, when Mrs. Damon had calmed herself. It was his habit to\nhave a method about doing things. \"And don't worry,\" he advised.\n\"I am certain some good will come of this. It proves one thing,\nthat's sure.\"\n\n\"What is it, Tom?\"\n\n\"That Mr. Damon is alive and well. Otherwise the message would not\nhave said he would be 'released.' It wasn't from anyone you know;\nwas it?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I never heard the voice before.\"\n\nTom paused a moment to think how useful his photo telephone and\nphonograph arrangement might have been in this case.\n\n\"How did the telephone call come in?\" inquired the young inventor.\n\n\"In the usual way,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"The bell rang, and, as I\nhappened to be near the instrument, I answered it, as I often do,\nwhen the maid is busy. A voice asked if I was Mrs. Damon, and of\ncourse I said I was. Then I heard this: 'Sign the land papers, and\nsend them to us, and your husband will be released.'\"\n\n\"Was that all?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"I think so--I made a note of it at the time.\" Mrs. Damon looked\ninto a small red book. \"No, that wasn't all,\" she said, quickly.\n\"I was so astonished, at hearing those strange words about my\nhusband, that I didn't know what to say. Before I could ask any\nquestions the voice went on to say, rather abruptly: 'We will call\nyou again.'\"\n\n\"That's good!\" cried Tom. \"I only hope they do it while I am here.\nPerhaps I can get some clue as to who it was called you. But was\nthis all you heard?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure that was all. I had forgotten about the last words,\nbut I see I have them written down in my note book.\"\n\n\"Did you ask any questions?\" inquired Tom.\n\n\"Oh, indeed I did! As soon as I got over being stunned by what I\nheard, I asked all sorts of questions. I demanded to know who was\nspeaking, what they meant, where they were, and all that. I begged\nthem to tell me something of my husband.\"\n\n\"And what did they say?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. There wasn't a sound in the telephone. The receiver\nwas hung up, breaking the connection after that message to me--that\nmysterious message.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was mysterious,\" agreed Tom, thoughtfully. \"I can't\nunderstand it. But didn't you try to learn from the central\noperator where the call had come from?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed, Tom! As soon as I found out the person speaking\nto me had rung off, I got the girl in the exchange.\"\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"That the call came from an automatic pay station in a drug store\nin town. I have the address. It was one of those telephones where\nyou put your money for the call in a slot.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, the first thing to do is for me to go to that drug\nstore and find out, if I can, who used the telephone about that\ntime. It's a slim chance, but we'll have to take it. Was it a\nman's voice, or a woman's?\"\n\n\"Oh, a man's, I'm sure. It was very deep and heavy. No woman could\nspeak like that.\"\n\n\"So much is settled, anyhow. Now about the land papers--what was\nmeant?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Mrs. Damon. \"You know part of our\nproperty--considerable land and some buildings--is in my name. Mr. Damon\nhad it fixed so a number of years ago, in order to protect me. No one\ncould get this property, and land, unless I signed the deeds, or\nagreed to sign them. Now all of Mr. Damon's fortune is tied up in\nsome of Mr. Peters's companies. That is why my husband has\ndisappeared.\"\n\n\"He didn't disappear--he was taken away against his will; I'm\npositive of that!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" agreed Mrs. Damon, sadly. \"But those are the papers\nreferred to, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" assented Tom. \"The rascals want to get control of\neverything--even your possessions. Not satisfied with ruining Mr.\nDamon, they want to make you a beggar, too. So they are playing on\nyour fears. They promise to release your husband if you will give\nthem the land.\"\n\n\"Yes, that must be it, Tom. What would you advise me to do? I am\nso frightened over this!\"\n\n\"Do? Don't you do anything!\" cried Tom. \"We'll fool these rascals\nyet. If they got those papers they might release Mr. Damon, or\nthey might not--fearing he would cause their arrest later. But\nwe'll have him released anyhow, and we'll save what is left of\nyour fortune. Put those land papers in a safe-deposit box, and let\nme do the rest. I'm going to catch those fellows!\"\n\n\"But how, Tom? You don't know who they are. And a mere message\nover a telephone won't give you a clue to where they are.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not an ordinary message,\" agreed Tom. \"But I'm going to\ntry some of my new inventions. You said they told you they were\ngoing to call again?\"\n\n\"That's what they said, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, when they do, I want to be here. I want to listen to that\nmessage. If you will allow me, I'll take up my residence here for\na while, Mrs. Damon.\"\n\n\"Allow you? I'll be only too glad if you will, Tom. But I thought\nyou were going to try to get some clue from the drug store where\nthe mysterious message came from.\"\n\n\"I'll let Ned Newton do that. I want to stay here.\"\n\nTom telephoned to Ned to meet him at Mrs. Damon's house, and also\nto bring with him certain things from the laboratory. And when Ned\narrived in an auto, with various bits of apparatus, Tom put in\nsome busy hours.\n\nMeanwhile Ned was sent to the drug store, to see if any clues\ncould be obtained there as to who had sent the message. As Tom had\nfeared, nothing could be learned. There were several automatic\n'phones in the place, and they were used very often during the day\nby the public. The drug clerks took little or no notice of the\npersons entering or leaving the booths, since the dropping of a\ncoin in the slot was all that was necessary to be connected with\ncentral.\n\n\"Well, we've got to wait for the second call here,\" said Tom, who\nhad been busy during Ned's absence. He had fitted to Mrs. Damon's\ntelephone a recording wax phonograph cylinder, to get a record of\nthe speaker's voice. And he had also put in an extension\ntelephone, so that he could listen while Mrs. Damon talked to the\nunknown.\n\n\"There, I guess we're ready for them,\" said Tom, late that\nafternoon. But no queer call came in that day. It was the next\nmorning, about ten o'clock, after Mrs. Damon had passed a restless\nnight, that the telephone bell rang. Tom, who was on the alert,\nwas at his auxiliary instrument in a flash. He motioned to Mrs.\nDamon to answer on the main wire.\n\n\"Hello,\" she spoke into the transmitter. \"Who is this?\"\n\n\"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" Tom heard come over the wire in a deep\nvoice, and by the manner in which Mrs. Damon signalled the young\ninventor knew that, at the other end of the line, was the\nmysterious man who had spoken before.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE BUZZING SOUND\n\n\n\"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" came the question again--rather more\nimpatiently this time, Tom thought.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the lady, glancing over at Tom. The extension\ntelephone was in the same room. Softly Tom switched on the\nphonograph attachment. The little wax cylinder began to revolve\nnoiselessly, ready to record the faintest word that came over the\nwire.\n\n\"You got a message from me yesterday,\" went on the hoarse voice.\nIn vain Tom tried to recall whether or not he had heard it before.\nHe could not place it.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Mrs. Damon. She and Tom had previously agreed\non a line of talk. \"Tell me your name, please.\"\n\n\"There's no need for any names to be used,\" went on the unknown at\nthe other end of the wire. \"You heard what I said yesterday. Are\nyou willing to send me those land title papers, if we release your\nhusband?\"\n\n\"But where shall I send them?\" asked Mrs. Damon, to gain time.\n\n\"You'll be told where. And listen--no tricks! You needn't try to\nfind out who I am, nor where I am. Just send those papers if you\nwant to see your husband again.\"\n\n\"Oh, how is he? Tell me about him! You are cruel to keep him a\nprisoner like this! I demand that you release him!\"\n\nTom had not told Mrs. Damon to say this. It came out of her own\nheart--she could not prevent the agonized outburst.\n\n\"Never mind about that, now,\" came the gruff voice over the wire.\n\"Are you willing to send the papers?\"\n\nMrs. Damon looked over to Tom for silent instructions. He nodded\nhis head in assent.\n\n\"Yes, I--I will send them if you tell me where to get them to you--if\nyou will release Mr. Damon,\" said the anxious wife. \"But tell\nme who you are--and where you are!\" she begged.\n\n\"None of that! I'm not looking to be arrested. You get the papers\nready, and I'll let you know to-morrow, about this time, where to\nsend them.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" called Mrs. Damon, to gain more time. \"I must\nknow just what papers you want.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll tell you,\" and he began to describe the different\nones.\n\nIt took a little time for the unknown to give this information to\nMrs. Damon. The man was very particular about the papers. There\nwere trust deeds, among other things, and he probably thought that\nonce he had possession of them, with Mrs. Damon's signature, even\nthough it had been obtained under a threat, he could claim the\nproperty. Later it was learned that such was not the case, for\nMrs. Damon, with Tom's aid, could have proved the fraud, had the\nscoundrels tried to get the remainder of the Damon fortune.\n\nBut at the time it seemed to the helpless woman that everything\nshe owned would be taken from her. Though she said she did not\ncare, as long as Mr. Damon was restored to her.\n\nAs I have said, the telephoning of the instructions about the\npapers took some time. Tom had counted on this, and had made his\nplans accordingly.\n\nAs soon as the telephone call had come in, Tom had communicated\nwith a private detective who was in waiting, and this man had gone\nto the drug store whence the first call had come. He was going to\ntry to make the arrest of the man telephoning.\n\nBut for fear the scoundrel would go to a different instrument, Tom\ntook another precaution. This was to have one of the operators in\nthe central exchange on the watch. As soon as Mrs. Damon's house\nwas in connection with another telephone, the location of the\nlatter would be noted, and another private detective would be sent\nthere. Thus Tom hoped to catch the man at the 'phone.\n\nMeanwhile Tom listened to the hoarse voice at the other end of the\nwire, giving the directions to Mrs. Damon. Tom hoped that soon\nthere would be an arrest made.\n\nMeanwhile the talk was being faithfully recorded on the phonograph\ncylinder. And, as the man talked on, Tom became aware of a curious\nundercurrent of sound. It was a buzzing noise, that Tom knew did\nnot come from the instrument itself. It was not the peculiar\ntapping, singing noise heard in a telephone receiver, caused by\ninduced electrical currents, or by wire trouble.\n\n\"This is certainly different,\" mused Tom. He was trying to recall\nwhere he had heard the noise before. Sometimes it was faint, and\nthen it would gradually increase, droning off into faintness once\nmore. Occasionally it was so loud that Mrs. Damon could not hear\nthe talk about the papers, and the man would have to repeat.\n\nBut finally he came to an end.\n\n\"This is all now,\" he said, sharply. Tom heard the words above the\nqueer, buzzing, humming sound. \"You are keeping me too long. I\nthink you are up to some game, but it won't do you any good, Mrs.\nDamon. I'll 'phone you to-morrow where to send the papers. And if\nyou don't send them--if you try any tricks--it will be the worse\nfor you and Mr. Damon!\"\n\nThere was a click, that told of a receiver being placed back on\nthe hook, and the voice ceased. So, also, did the queer, buzzing\nsound over which Tom puzzled.\n\n\"What can it have been?\" he asked. \"Did you hear it, Mrs. Damon?\"\n\n\"What, Tom?\"\n\n\"That buzzing sound.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard, but I didn't know what it was. Oh, Tom, what shall\nI do?\"\n\n\"Don't worry. We'll see if anything happened. They may have caught\nthat fellow. If not I'll plan another scheme.\"\n\nTom's first act was to call up the telephone exchange to learn\nwhere the second call had come from. He got the information at\nonce. The address was in the suburbs. The man had not gone to the\ndrug store this time.\n\n\"Did the detective get out to that address?\" asked Tom eagerly of\nthe manager.\n\n\"Yes. As soon as we were certain that he was the party you wanted,\nyour man got right after him, Mr. Swift.\"\n\n\"That's good, I hope he catches him!\" cried the young inventor. \"We'll\nhave to wait and find out.\"\n\n\"He said he'd call up and let you know as soon as he reached the\nplace,\" the telephone manager informed Tom.\n\nThere was nothing to do but wait, and meanwhile Tom did what he\ncould to comfort Mrs. Damon. She was quite nervous and inclined to\nbe hysterical, and the youth thought it wise to have a cousin, who\nhad come to stay with her, summon the doctor.\n\n\"But, Tom, what shall I do about those papers?\" Mrs. Damon asked\nhim. \"Shall I send them?\"\n\n\"Indeed not!\"\n\n\"But I want Mr. Damon restored to me,\" she pleaded. \"I don't care\nabout the money. He can make more.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll not give those scoundrels the satisfaction of getting\nany money out of you. Just wait now, I'll work this thing out, and\nfind a way to catch that fellow. If I could only think what that\nbuzzing sound was--\"\n\nThen, in a flash, it came to Tom.\n\n\"A sawmill! A planing mill!\" he cried. \"That's what it was! That\nfellow was telephoning from some place near a sawmill!\"\n\nThe telephone rang in the midst of Tom's excited comments.\n\n\"Yes--yes!\" he called eagerly. \"Who is it--what is it?\"\n\n\"This is Larsen--the private detective you sent.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you were at the drug store.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Swift. Well, that party didn't call up from here.\"\n\n\"I know, Larsen. It was from another station. We're after him.\nMuch obliged to you. Come on back.\"\n\nTom was sure his theory was right. The man had called up the Damon\nhouse from some telephone near a sawmill. And a little later Tom's\ntheory was proved to be true. He got a report from the second\ndetective. Unfortunately the man had not been able to reach the\ntelephone station before the unknown speaker had departed.\n\n\"Was the place near a sawmill?\" asked Tom, eagerly.\n\n\"It was,\" answered the detective over the wire. \"The telephone is\nright next door to one. It's an automatic pay station and no one\nseems to have noticed who the man was who telephoned. I couldn't\nget a single clue. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Tom, as cheerfully as he could. \"I think I'm on\nthe right track now. I'm going to lay a trap for this fellow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nSETTING THE TRAP\n\n\nTroublesome problems seemed to be multiplying for Tom Swift. He\nadmitted as much himself after the failure to capture the man who\nhad telephoned to Mrs. Damon. He had hoped that his plan of\nsending detectives to the location of the telephones would\nsucceed. Since it had not the youth must try other means.\n\n\"Now, Ned,\" he said to his chum, when they were on their way from\nMrs. Damon's, it being impossible to do anything further there.\n\"Now, Ned, we've got to think this thing out together.\"\n\n\"I'm willing, Tom. I'll do what I can.\"\n\n\"I know you will. Now the thing to do is to go at this thing\nsystematically. Otherwise we'll be working around in a circle, and\nwon't get anywhere. In the first place, let's set down what we do\nknow. Then we'll put down what we don't know, and go after that.\"\n\n\"Put down what you don't know?\" exclaimed Ned. \"How are you going\nto put down a thing when you don't know it?\"\n\n\"I mean we can put a question mark after it, so to speak. For\ninstance we don't know where Mr. Damon is, but we want to find\nout.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. Well, let's start off with the things we do know.\"\n\nThe two friends were at Tom's house by now, having come from\nWaterford in Tom's airship. After thinking over all the exciting\nhappenings of the past few days, Tom remarked: \"Now, Ned, for the\nthings we do know. In the first place Mr. Damon is missing, and\nhis fortune is about gone. There is considerable left to Mrs.\nDamon, however, but those scoundrels may get that away from her,\nif we don't watch out. Secondly, my airship was taken and brought\nback, with a button more than it had when it went away. Said\nbutton exactly matched one off Mr. Boylan's coat.\"\n\n\"Thirdly, Mr. Damon was either taken away or went away, in an\nairship--either in mine or someone else's. Fourthly, Mrs. Damon\nhas received telephonic communications from the man, or men, who\nhave her husband. Fifthly, Mr. Peters, either legally or\nillegally, is responsible for the loss of Mr. Damon's fortune.\nNow: there you are--for the things we do know.\"\n\n\"Now for the things we don't know. We don't know who has taken\nMr. Damon away, nor where he is, to begin with the most important.\"\n\n\"Hold on, Tom, I think you're wrong,\" broke in Ned.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"About not knowing who is responsible for the taking away of Mr.\nDamon. I think it's as plain as the nose on your face that Peters\nis responsible.\"\n\n\"I can't see it that way,\" said Tom, quickly. \"I will admit that\nit looks as though Boylan had been in my airship, but as for\nPeters taking Mr. Damon away--why, Peters is around town all the\nwhile, and if he had a hand in the disappearance of Mr. Damon, do\nyou think he'd stay here, when he knows we are working on the\ncase? And would he send Boylan to see me if Boylan had been one of\nthose who had a hand in it? They wouldn't dare, especially as they\nknow I'm working on the case.\"\n\n\"Peters is a bad lot. I'll grant you, though, he was fair enough\nto pay for my motor boat. I don't believe he had anything to do\nwith taking Mr. Damon away.\"\n\n\"Do you think he was the person who was talking to Mrs. Damon\nabout the papers?\"\n\n\"No, Ned. I don't. I listened to that fellow's voice carefully. It\nwasn't like Peters's. I'm going to put it in the phonograph, too,\nand let you listen to it. Then see what you say.\"\n\nTom did this, a little later. The record of the voice, as it came\nover the wire, was listened to from the wax cylinder, and Ned had\nto admit that it was not much like that of the promoter.\n\n\"Well, what's next to be done?\" asked the young banker.\n\n\"I'm going to set a trap,\" replied Tom, with a grin.\n\n\"Set a trap?\"\n\n\"Yes, a sort of mouse-trap. I'm glad my photo telephone is now\nperfected, Ned.\"\n\n\"What has that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"That's going to be my trap, Ned. Here is my game. You know this\nfellow--this strange unknown--is going to call up Mrs. Damon\nto-morrow. Well, I'll be ready for him. I'm going to put in the booth\nwhere he will telephone from, one of my photo telephones--that is, the\nsending apparatus. In Mrs. Damon's house, attached to her telephone,\nwill be the receiving plate, as well as the phonograph cylinder.\"\n\n\"When this fellow starts to talk he'll be sending us his picture,\nthough he won't know it, and we'll be getting a record of his\nvoice. Then we'll have him just where we want him.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Ned. \"But, Tom, there's a weak spot in your mouse-trap.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"How are you going to know which telephone the unknown will call\nup from? He may go to any of a hundred, more or less.\"\n\n\"He might--yes. But that's a chance we've got to take. It isn't so\nmuch of a chance, though when you stop to think that he will\nprobably go to some public telephone in an isolated spot, and,\nunless I'm much mistaken he will go to a telephone near where he\nwas to-day. He knows that was safe, since we didn't capture him,\nand he's very likely to come back.\"\n\n\"But to make the thing as sure as possible, I'm going to attach my\napparatus to a number of public telephones in the vicinity of the\none near the sawmill. So if the fellow doesn't get caught in one,\nhe will in another. I admit it's taking a chance; but what else\ncan we do?\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right, Tom. It's like setting a number of\ntraps.\"\n\n\"Exactly. A trapper can't be sure where he is going to get his\ncatch, so he picks out the place, or run-way, where the game has\nbeen in the habit of coming. He hides his traps about that place,\nand trusts to luck that the animal will blunder into one of them.\"\n\n\"Criminals, to my way of thinking, are a good bit like animals.\nThey seem to come back to their old haunts. Nearly any police\nstory proves this. And it's that on which I am counting to capture\nthis criminal. So I'm going to fit up as many telephones with my\nphoto and phonograph outfit, as I can in the time we have. You'll\nhave to help me. Luckily I've got plenty of selenium plates for\nthe sending end. I'll only need one at the receiving end. Now\nwe'll have to go and have a talk with the telephone manager, after\nwhich we'll get busy.\"\n\n\"You've overlooked one thing, Tom.\"\n\n\"What's that, Ned?\"\n\n\"Why, if you know about which telephone this fellow is going to\nuse, why can't you have police stationed near it to capture him as\nsoon as he begins to talk?\"\n\n\"Well, I did think of that, Ned; but it won't work.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because, in the first place this man, or some of his friends,\nwill be on the watch. When he goes into the place to telephone\nthere'll be a look-out, I'm sure, and he'd either put off talking\nto Mrs. Damon, or he'd escape before we had any evidence against\nhim.\"\n\n\"You see I've got to get evidence that will stand in the courts to\nconvict this fellow, and if he's scared off before we get that,\nthe game will be up.\"\n\n\"That's what my photo telephone will do--it will get the evidence,\njust as a dictaphone does. In fact, I'm thinking of working it out\non those lines, after I clear up this business.\"\n\n\"Just suppose we had detectives stationed at all the telephones\nnear the sawmill, where this fellow would be likely to go. In the\nfirst place no one has seen him, as far as we know, so there's no\ntelling what sort of a chap he is. And you can't go up to a\nperfect stranger and arrest him because you think he is the man\nwho has spirited away Mr. Damon.\"\n\n\"Another thing. Until this fellow has talked, and made his offer\nto Mrs. Damon, to restore her husband, in exchange for certain\npapers, we have no hold over him.\"\n\n\"But he has done that, Tom. You heard him, and you have his voice\ndown on the wax cylinder.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I haven't had a glimpse of his face. That's what I want,\nand what I'm going to get. Suppose he does go into the telephone\nbooth, and tell Mrs. Damon an address where she is to send the\npapers. Even if a detective was near at hand he might not catch\nwhat was said. Or, if he did, on what ground could he arrest a man\nwho, very likely, would be a perfect stranger to him? The\ndetective couldn't say: 'I take you into custody for telephoning\nan address to Mrs. Damon.' That, in itself, is no crime.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not,\" admitted Ned. \"You've got this all thought\nout, Tom.\"\n\n\"I hope I have. You see it takes quite a combination to get\nevidence against a criminal--evidence that will convict him.\nThat's why I have to be so careful in setting my trap.\"\n\n\"I see, Tom. Well, it's about time for us to get busy; isn't it?\"\n\n\"It sure is. There's lots to do. First we'll go see the telephone\npeople.\"\n\nTom explained to the 'phone manager the necessity for what he was\nabout to do. The manager at once agreed to let the young inventor\nhave a free hand. He was much interested in the photo telephone,\nand Tom promised to give his company a chance to use it on their\nlines, later.\n\nThe telephone near the sawmill was easily located. It was in a\ngeneral store, and the instrument was in a booth. To this\ninstrument Tom attached his sending plate, and he also substituted\nfor the ordinary incandescent light, a powerful tungsten one, that\nwould give illumination enough to cause the likeness to be\ntransmitted over the wire.\n\nThe same thing was done to a number of the public telephones in\nthat vicinity, each one being fitted up so that the picture of\nwhoever talked would be transmitted over the wire when Tom turned\nthe switch. To help the plan further the telephone manager marked\na number of other 'phones, \"Out of Order,\" for the time being.\n\n\"Now, I think we're done!\" exclaimed the young inventor, with a\nsigh, late that night. He and Ned and the line manager had worked\nhard.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the young banker, \"the traps are set. The question\nis: Will our rat be caught?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE PHOTO TELEPHONE\n\n\nTom Swift was taking, as he afterward confessed, \"a mighty big\nchance.\" But it seemed the only way. He was working against\ncunning men, and had to be as cunning as they.\n\nTrue, the man he hoped to capture, through the combination of his\nphoto telephone and the phonograph, might go to some other\ninstrument than one of those Tom had adjusted. But this could not\nbe helped. In all he had put his new attachment on eight 'phones\nin the vicinity of the sawmill. So he had eight chances in his\nfavor, and as many against him as there were other telephones in\nuse.\n\n\"It's a mighty small margin in our favor,\" sighed Tom.\n\n\"It sure is,\" agreed Ned. They were at Mrs. Damon's house,\nwaiting for the call to come in.\n\n\"But we couldn't do anything else,\" went on Tom.\n\n\"No,\" spoke Ned, \"and I have a great deal of hope in the\nproverbial Swift luck, Tom.\"\n\n\"Well, I only hope it holds good this time!\" laughed the young\ninventor.\n\n\"There are a good many things that can go wrong,\" observed Ned.\n\"The least little slip-up may spoil your traps, Tom.\"\n\n\"I know it, Ned. But I've got to take the chance. We've just got\nto do something for Mrs. Damon. She's wearing herself out by\nworrying,\" he added in a low voice, for indeed the wife of his\nfriend felt the absence of her husband greatly. She had lost\nflesh, she ate scarcely anything, and her nights were wakeful ones\nof terror.\n\n\"What if this fails?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"Then I'm going to work that button clue to the limit,\" replied\nTom. \"I'll go to Boylan and see what he and Peters have to say.\"\n\n\"If you'd done as I suggested you'd have gone to them first,\"\nspoke Ned. \"You'll find they're mixed up in this.\"\n\n\"Maybe; but I doubt it. I tell you there isn't a clue leading to\nPeters--as yet.\"\n\n\"But there will be,\" insisted Ned. \"You'll see that that I'm right\nthis time.\"\n\n\"I can't see it, Ned. As a matter of fact, I would have gone to\nBoylan about that button I found in my airship only I've been so\nbusy on this photo telephone, and in arranging the trap, that I\nhaven't had time. But if this fails--and I'm hoping it won't--I'll\nget after him,\" and there was a grim look on the young inventor's\nface.\n\nIt was wearying and nervous work--this waiting. Tom and Ned felt\nthe strain as they sat there in Mrs. Damon's library, near the\ntelephone. It had been fitted up in readiness. Attached to the\nreceiving wires was a sensitive plate, on which Tom hoped would be\nimprinted the image of the man at the other end of the wire--the\ncriminal who, in exchange for the valuable land papers, would give\nMr. Damon his liberty.\n\nThere was also the phonograph cylinder to record the man's voice.\nSeveral times, while waiting for the call to come in, Tom got up\nto test the apparatus. It was in perfect working order.\n\nAs before, there was an extension telephone, so that Mrs. Damon\ncould talk to the unknown, while Tom could hear as well. But he\nplanned to take no part in the conversation unless something\nunforeseen occurred.\n\nMr. Damon was an enthusiastic photographer, and he had a dark room\nadjoining his library. It was in this dark room that Tom planned\nto develop the photo telephone plate.\n\nOn this occasion he was not going to use the metal plate in which,\nordinarily, the image of the person talking appeared. That record\nwas but a fleeting one, as in a mirror. This time Tom wanted a\npermanent picture that could, if necessary, be used in a court of\njustice.\n\nTom's plan was this: If the person who had demanded the papers\ncame to one of the photo telephones, and spoke to Mrs. Damon, Tom\nwould switch on the receiving apparatus. Thus, while the man was\ntalking, his picture would be taken, though he would not know of\nthe thing being done.\n\nHis voice would also be recorded on the wax cylinder, and he would\nbe equally unaware of this.\n\nWhen Tom had imprinted the fellow's image on the prepared plate,\nhe would go quickly to the dark room and develop it. A wet print\ncould be made, and with this as evidence, and to use in\nidentification, a quick trip could be made to the place whence the\nman had telephoned. Tom hoped thus to capture him.\n\nTo this end he had his airship in waiting, and as soon as he had\ndeveloped the picture he planned to rush off to the vicinity of\nthe sawmill, and make a prisoner of the man whose features would\nbe revealed to him over the wire.\n\nIt was a hazardous plan--a risky one--but it was the best that he\ncould evolve. Tom had instructed Mrs. Damon to keep the man in\nconversation as long as possible, in order to give the young\ninventor himself time to rush off in his airship. But of course\nthe man might get suspicious and leave. That was another chance\nthat had to be taken.\n\n\"If I had thought of it in time,\" said Tom, musingly, as he paced\nup and down in the library waiting for the 'phone to ring, \"if I\nhad thought of it in time I would have rigged up two plates--one\nfor a temporary, or looking-glass, picture, and the other for a\npermanent one. In that way I could rush off as soon as I got a\nglimpse of the fellow. But it's too late to do that now. I'll have\nto develop this plate.\"\n\nWaiting is the most wearisome work there is. Tom and Ned found\nthis to be the case, as they sat there, hoping each moment that\nthe telephone bell would ring, and that the man at the other end\nof the wire would be the mysterious stranger. Mrs. Damon, too,\nfelt the nervous strain.\n\n\"This is about the hour he called up yesterday,\" said Tom, in a\nlow voice, after coming back from a trip to the window to see that\nhis airship was in readiness. He had brought Koku over to help in\nstarting it, for he was using his most powerful and speedy craft,\nand the propellers were hard to turn.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"It was just about this hour, Tom. Oh,\nI do hope--\"\n\nShe was interrupted by the jingle of the telephone bell. With a\njump Tom was at the auxiliary instrument, while Mrs. Damon lifted\noff the receiver of her own telephone.\n\n\"Yes; what is it?\" she asked, in a voice that she tried to make\ncalm.\n\n\"Do you know who this is?\" Tom heard come over the wire.\n\n\"Are you the--er--the person who was to give me an address where I\nam to send certain papers?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm the same one. I'm glad to see that you have acted\nsensibly. If I get the papers all right, you'll soon have your\nhusband back. Now do as I say. Take down this address.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" assented Mrs. Damon. She looked over at Tom. He was\nintently listening, and he, too, would note the address given. The\ntrap was about to be sprung. The game had walked into it. Just\nwhich telephone was being used Tom could not as yet tell. It was\nevidently not the one nearest the planing mill, for Tom could not\nhear the buzzing sound. It was well he had put his attachment on\nseveral instruments.\n\n\"One moment, please,\" said Mrs. Damon, to the unknown at the other\nend of the wire. This was in accordance with the pre-arranged\nplan.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked the man, impatiently. \"I have no time to\nwaste.\"\n\nTom heard again the same gruff tones, and he tried in vain to\nrecognize them.\n\n\"I want you take down a message to Mr. Damon,\" said his wife.\n\"This is very important. It can do you no harm to give him this\nmessage; but I want you to get it exact. If you do not promise to\ndeliver it I shall call all negotiations off.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right I'll take the message; but be quick about it. Then\nI'll give you the address where you are to send the papers.\"\n\n\"This is the message,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"Please write it down.\nIt is very important to me. Have you a pencil?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have one. Wait until I get a bit of paper. It's so dark in\nthis booth--wait until I turn on the light.\"\n\nTom could not repress a pleased and joyful exclamation. It was\njust what he had hoped the man would do--turn on the light in the\nbooth. Indeed, it was necessary for the success of the trap that\nthe light be switched on. Otherwise no picture could be\ntransmitted over the wire. And the plan of having the man write\ndown a message to Mr. Damon was arranged with that end in view.\nThe man would need a light to see to write, and Tom's apparatus\nmust be lighted in order to make it work. The plot was coming\nalong finely.\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed the man at the other end of the wire. \"I have a\nlight now. Go ahead with your message, Mrs. Damon. But make it\nshort. I can't stay here long.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Damon began dictating the message she and Tom had agreed\nupon. It was as long as they dared make it, for they wanted to\nkeep the man in the booth to the last second.\n\n\"Dear Husband,\" began Mrs. Damon. What the message was does not\nmatter. It has nothing to do with this story. Sufficient to say\nthat the moment the man began writing it down, as Tom could tell\nover the sensitive wire, by the scratching of the pencil--at that\nmoment Tom, knowing the light was on in the distant telephone\nbooth, switched on the picture-taking apparatus. His receiving\napparatus at once indicated that the image was being made on the\nsensitive plate.\n\nIt took only a few seconds of time, and with the plate in the\nholder Tom hastened to the dark room to develop it. Ned took his\nchum's place at the telephone, to see that all worked smoothly.\nThe photo telephone had done it's work. Whose image would be found\nimprinted on the sensitive plate? Tom's hands trembled so that he\ncould scarcely put it in the developing solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE ESCAPE\n\n\nNed Newton, listening at the auxiliary telephone heard the man, to\nwhom Mrs. Damon was dictating her message to her husband, utter an\nexclamation of impatience.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't take down any more,\" he called. \"That is\nenough. Now you listen. I want you to send me those papers.\"\n\n\"And I am willing to,\" went on Mrs. Damon, while Ned listened to\nthe talk, the phonograph faithfully recording it.\n\n\"I wonder whose picture Tom will find,\" mused Ned.\n\nThe unknown, at the other end of the wire, began giving Mrs. Damon\na description of just what papers he wanted, and how to mail them\nto him. He gave an address that Ned recognized as that of a cigar\nstore, where many persons received their mail under assumed names.\nThe postal authorities had, for a long time, tried to get evidence\nagainst it.\n\n\"That's going to make it hard to get him, when he comes for the\npapers,\" thought Ned. \"He's a foxy criminal, all right. But I\nguess Tom will turn the trick.\"\n\nMrs. Damon was carefully noting down the address. She really\nintended to send the papers, if it proved that there was no other\nway in which she could secure the release of her husband. But she\ndid not count on all of Tom's plans. \"Why doesn't he develop that\nplate?\" thought Ned. \"He'll be too late, in spite of his airship.\nThat fellow will skip.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that Tom came into the library. He moved\ncautiously, for he realized that a loud sound in the room would\ncarry to the man at the other end of the wire. Tom motioned for\nNed to come to him. He held out a dripping photographic plate.\n\n\"It's Peters!\" said Tom, in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Peters?\" gasped Ned. \"How could it be? His voice--\"\n\n\"I know. It didn't sound a bit like Peters over the 'phone, but\nthere's his picture, all right!\"\n\nTom held up the plate. There, imprinted on it by the wonderful\npower of the young inventor's latest appliance, was the image of\nthe rascally promoter. As plainly as in life he was shown, even to\nhis silk hat and the flower in his button-hole. He was in a\ntelephone booth--that much could be told from the photograph that\nhad been transmitted over the wire, but which booth could not be\nsaid--they were nearly all alike.\n\n\"Peters!\" gasped Ned. \"I thought he was the fellow, Tom.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. You were right, and I was wrong. But I did not\nrecognize his voice. It was very hoarse. He must have a bad cold.\"\nLater this was learned to have been the case. \"There's no time to\nlose,\" whispered Tom, while Mrs. Damon was doing her best to\nprolong the conversation in order to hold the man at the other end\nof the wire. \"Ned, get central on the other telephone, and see\nwhere this call came from. Then we'll get there as fast as the\nairship will take us.\"\n\nA second and temporary telephone line had been installed in the\nDamon home, and on this Ned was soon talking, while Tom, putting\nthe photographic plate away for future use, rushed out to get his\nairship in shape for a quick flight. He had modified his plans.\nInstead of having a detective take a print of the photo telephone\nimage, and make the arrest, Tom was going to try to capture Peters\nhimself. He believed he could do it. One look at the wet plate was\nenough. He knew Peters, though it upset some of his theories to\nlearn that it was the promoter who was responsible for Mr. Damon's\ndisappearance.\n\nThe man at the other end of the wire was evidently getting\nimpatient. Possibly he suspected some trick. \"I've got to go now,\"\nhe called to Mrs. Damon. \"If I don't get those papers in the\nmorning it will be the worse for Mr. Damon.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll send you the papers,\" she said.\n\nBy this time Ned had gotten into communication with the manager of\nthe central telephone exchange, and had learned the location of\nthe instrument Peters was using. It was about a mile from the one\nnear the sawmill.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Tom to his chum, as the latter gave him this\ninformation. \"The Firefly is tuned up for a hundred miles an hour!\nWe'll be there in ten minutes! We must catch him red-handed, if\npossible!\"\n\n\"He's gone!\" gasped Mrs. Damon as she came to the outer door, and\nwatched Tom and Ned taking their places in the airship, while Koku\nprepared to twirl the propellers.\n\n\"Gone!\" echoed Tom, blankly.\n\n\"Yes, he hung up the receiver.\"\n\n\"See if you can't get him back,\" suggested the young inventor.\n\"Ask Central to ring that number again. We'll be there in a jiffy.\nMaybe he'll come to the telephone again. Or he may even call up\nhis partners and tell them the game is working his way. Try to get\nhim back, Mrs. Damon.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she said.\n\nAnd, as she hurried back to the instrument, Tom and Ned shot up\ntoward the blue sky in an endeavor to capture the man at the other\ntelephone.\n\n\"And to think it was Peters!\" cried Tom into Ned's ear, shouting\nto be heard above the roar of the motor exhaust.\n\n\"I thought he'd turn out to be mixed up in the affair,\" said Ned.\n\n\"Well, you were right. I was off, that time,\" admitted Tom, as he\nguided his powerful craft above the trees. \"I was willing to admit\nthat he had something to do with Mr. Damon's financial trouble,\nbut as for kidnapping him--well, you never can tell.\"\n\nThey drove on at a breath-catching pace, and it seemed hardly a\nminute after leaving Mrs. Damon's house before Tom called:\n\n\"There's the building where the telephone is located.\"\n\n\"And now for that rascal Peters!\" cried Ned.\n\nThe airship swooped down, to the great astonishment of some\nworkmen nearby.\n\nHardly had the wheels ceased revolving on the ground, as Tom made\na quick landing, than he was out of his seat, and running toward\nthe telephone. He knew the place at once from having heard Ned's\ndescription, and besides, this was one of the places where he had\ninstalled his apparatus.\n\nInto the store Tom burst, and made a rush for the 'phone booth. He\nthrew open the door. The place was empty!\n\n\"The man--the man who was telephoning!\" Tom called to the\nproprietor of the place.\n\n\"You mean that big man, with the tall hat, who was in there so\nlong?\"\n\n\"Yes, where is he?\"\n\n\"Gone. About two minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Which way?\"\n\n\"Over toward Shopton, and in one of the fastest autos that ever\nscattered dust in this section.\"\n\n\"He's escaped us!\" said Tom to Ned. \"But we'll get him yet! Come\non!\"\n\n\"I'm with you. Say, do you know what this looks like to me?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It looks as if Peters was scared and was going to run away to\nstay!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\n\nSuch a crowd had quickly gathered about Tom's airship that it was\nimpossible to start it. Men and boys, and even some girls and\nwomen, coming from no one knew where, stood about the machine,\nmaking wondering remarks about it.\n\n\"Stand back, if you please!\" cried Tom, good-naturedly. \"We've\ngot to get after the fellow in the auto.\"\n\n\"You'll have hard work catching him, friend, in that rig,\"\nremarked a man. \"He was fracturing all the speed laws ever passed.\nI reckon he was going nigh onto sixty miles an hour.\"\n\n\"We can make a hundred,\" spoke Ned, quietly.\n\n\"A hundred! Get out!\" cried the man. \"Nothing can go as fast as\nthat!\"\n\n\"We'll show you, if we once get started,\" said Tom. \"I guess we'll\nhave to get one of these fellows to twirl the propellers for us,\nNed,\" he added. \"I didn't think, or I'd have brought the self-starting\nmachine,\" for this one of Tom's had to be started by someone\nturning over the propellers, once or twice, to enable the motor\nto begin to speed. On some of his aircraft the young inventor had\nattached a starter, something like the ones on the newest autos.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned, as Tom looked to the\npriming of the cylinders.\n\n\"I'm going to get on the trail of Peters,\" he said. \"He's at the\nbottom of the whole business; and it's a surprise to me. I'm going\nto trail him right down to the ground now, and make him give up\nMr. Damon and his fortune.\"\n\n\"But you don't know where he is, Tom.\"\n\n\"I'll find out. He isn't such an easy man to miss--he's too\nconspicuous. Besides, if he's just left in his auto we may catch\nhim before he gets to Shopton.\"\n\n\"Do you think he's going there?\"\n\n\"I think so. And I think, Ned, that he's become suspicious and\nwill light out. Something must have happened, while he was\ntelephoning, and he got frightened, as big a bluff as he is. But\nwe'll get him. Come on! Will you turn over the propellers, please?\nI'll show you how to do it,\" Tom went on to a big, strong man\nstanding close to the blades.\n\n\"Sure I'll do it,\" was the answer. \"I was a helper once at an\nairship meet, and I know how.\"\n\n\"Get back out of the way in time,\" the young inventor warned him.\n\"They start very suddenly, sometimes.\"\n\n\"All right, friend, I'll watch out,\" was the reply, and with Tom\nand Ned in their seats, the former at the steering wheel, the\ncraft of the air was soon throbbing and trembling under the first\nturn, for the cylinders were still warm from the run from Mrs.\nDamon's house.\n\nThe telephone was in an outlying section of Waterford--a section\ndevoted in the main to shops and factories, and the homes of those\nemployed in various lines of manufacture. Peters had chosen his\nplace well, for there were many roads leading to and from this\nsection, and he could easily make his escape.\n\n\"But we'll get after him,\" thought Tom, grimly, as he let the\nairship run down the straight road a short distance on the bicycle\nwheels, to give it momentum enough so that it would rise.\n\nThen, with the tilting of the elevation rudder, the craft rose\ngracefully, amid admiring cheers from the crowd. Tom did not go up\nvery far, as he wanted to hover near the ground, to pick out the\nspeeding auto containing Peters.\n\nBut this time luck was not with Tom. He and Ned did sight a number\nof cars speeding along the highway toward Shopton, but when they\ngot near enough to observe the occupants they were disappointed\nnot to behold the man they sought. Tom circled about for some\ntime, but it was of no use, and then he headed his craft back\ntoward Waterford.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Ned, yelling the words into the ear\nof his chum.\n\n\"Back to Mrs. Damon's,\" answered Tom, in equally loud tones.\n\nIt was impossible to talk above the roaring and throbbing of the\nmotor, so the two lads kept silent until the airship had landed\nnear Mrs. Damon's home.\n\n\"I want to see if Mrs. Damon is all right,\" Tom explained, as he\njumped from the still moving machine. \"Then we'll go to Shopton,\nand cause Peters's arrest. I can make a charge against him now,\nand the evidence of the photo telephone will convict him, I'm\nsure. And I also want to see if Mrs. Damon has had any other\nword.\"\n\nShe had not, however, though she was more nervous and worried than\never.\n\n\"Oh, Tom, what shall I do?\" she exclaimed. \"I am so frightened!\nWhat do you suppose they will do to Mr. Damon?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all!\" Tom assured her. \"He will be all right. I think\nmatters are coming to a crisis now, and very likely he'll be with\nyou inside of twenty-four hours. The game is up, and I guess\nPeters knows it. I'm going to have him arrested at once.\"\n\n\"Shall I send those land papers, Tom?\"\n\n\"Indeed you must not! But I'll talk to you about that later. Just\nput away that phonograph record of Peters's talk. I'll take along\nthe photo telephone negative, and have some prints made--or, I\nguess, since we're going in the airship, that I'd better leave it\nhere for the present. We'll use it as evidence against Peters.\nCome on, Ned.\"\n\n\"Where to now?\"\n\n\"Peters's house. He's probably there, arranging to cover up his\ntracks when he lights out.\"\n\nBut Shallock Peters did better than merely cover up his tracks. He\ncovered himself up, so to speak. For when Ned and Tom, after a\nquick flight in the airship, reached his house, the promoter had\nleft, and the servants, who were quite excited, did not know where\nhe had gone.\n\n\"He just packed up a few clothes and ran out,\" said one of the\nmaids. \"He didn't say anything about our wages, either, and he\nowes me over a month.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said another.\n\n\"Well, if he doesn't pay me some of my back wages soon, I'll sue\nhim!\" declared the gardener. \"He owes me more than three months,\nbut he kept putting me off.\"\n\nAnd, so it seemed, Peters had done with several of his employes.\nWhen the promoter came to Shopton he had taken an elaborate house\nand engaged a staff of servants. Peters was not married, but he\ngave a number of entertainments to which the wealthy men of\nShopton and their wives came. Later it was found that the bills\nfor these had never been paid. In short, Peters was a \"bluff\" in\nmore ways than one.\n\nTom told enough of his story to the servants to get them on his\nside. Indeed, now that their employer had gone, and under such\nqueer circumstances, they had no sympathy for him. They were only\nconcerned about their own money, and Tom was given admittance to\nthe house.\n\nTom made a casual search, hoping to find some clue to the\nwhereabouts of Mr. Damon, or to get some papers that would save\nhis fortune. But the search was unsuccessful.\n\nThere was a safe in the room Peters used for an office, but when\nTom got there the strong box was open, and only some worthless\ndocuments remained.\n\n\"He smelled a rat, all right,\" said Tom, grimly. \"After he\ntelephoned to Mrs. Damon something happened that gave him an\nintimation that someone was after him. So he got away as soon as\nhe could.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do about it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Get right after him. He can't have gotten very far. I want him\nand I want Boylan. We're getting close to the end of the trail,\nNed.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we haven't found Mr. Damon yet, and his fortune seems to\nhave vanished.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll do the best we can,\" said Tom, grimly. \"Now I'm going\nto get a warrant for the arrest of Peters, and one for Boylan, and\nI'm going to get myself appointed a special officer with power to\nserve them. We've got our work cut out for us, Ned.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm with you to the end.\"\n\n\"I know you are!\" cried Tom.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE LONELY HOUSE\n\n\nThe young inventor had little difficulty in getting the warrants\nhe sought. In the case of Boylan, who seemed to be Peters's\nright-hand man, when it came to criminal work, Tom made a charge of\nunlawfully taking the airship. This would be enough to hold the\nman on until other evidence could be obtained against him.\n\nAs for Peters, he was accused of taking certain valuable bonds and\nstocks belonging to Mr. Damon. Mrs. Damon gave the necessary\nevidence in this case, and the authorities were told that later,\nwhen Peters should have been arrested, other evidence so\nskillfully gotten by Tom's photo telephone, would be brought\nbefore the court.\n\n\"It's a new way of convicting a man--by a photo telephone--but I\nguess it's a good one,\" said the judge who signed the warrants.\n\n\"Well, now that we've got what we want, the next thing to do is to\nget the men--Peters, and the others,\" said Tom, as he and Ned sat\nin Tom's library after several hours of strenuous work.\n\n\"How are you going to start?\" the young banker wanted to know. \"It\nseems a strange thing that a man like Mr. Damon could be made away\nwith, and kept in hiding so long without something being heard of\nhim. I'm afraid, Tom, that something must have happened to him.\"\n\n\"I think so too, Ned. Nothing serious, though,\" Tom added,\nquickly, as he saw the look of alarm on his chum's face. \"I think\nMr. Damon at first went away of his own accord.\"\n\n\"Of his own accord?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think Peters induced him to go with him, on the pretense\nthat he could recover his fortune. After getting Mr. Damon in\ntheir power they kept him, probably to get the rest of his fortune\naway from him.\"\n\n\"But you stopped that, Tom,\" said Ned, proud of his chum's\nabilities.\n\n\"Well, I hope so,\" admitted the young inventor. \"But I've still\ngot plenty to do.\"\n\n\"Have you a starting point?\"\n\n\"For one thing,\" Tom answered, \"I'm going to have Mrs. Damon mail\na fake package to the address Peters gave. If he, or any of his\nmen, call for it, we'll have a detective on the watch, and arrest\nthem.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"Of course it may not work,\" spoke Tom; \"but it's something to\ntry, and we can't miss any chances.\"\n\nAccordingly, the next day, a package containing only blank paper,\nmade up to represent the documents demanded by Peters as the price\nof releasing Mr. Damon, was mailed to the address Mrs. Damon had\nreceived over the wire from the rascally promoter. Then a private\ndetective was engaged to be on the watch, to take into custody\nwhoever called for the bundle. Tom, though, had not much hope of\nanything coming of this, as it was evident that Peters had taken\nthe alarm, and left.\n\n\"And now,\" said Tom, when he had safely put away the wax record,\ncontaining the incriminating talk of Peters, and had printed\nseveral photographs, so wonderfully taken over the wire, \"now to\nget on the trail again.\"\n\nIt was not an easy one to follow. Tom began at the deserted home\nof the alleged financier. The establishment was broken up, for\nmany tradesmen came with bills that had not been paid, and some of\nthem levied on what little personal property there was to satisfy\ntheir claims. The servants left, sorrowful enough over their\nmissing wages. The place was closed up under the sheriff's orders.\n\nBut of Peters and his men not a trace could be found. Tom and Ned\ntraveled all over the surrounding country, looking for clues, but\nin vain. They made several trips in the airship, but finally\ndecided that an automobile was more practical for their work, and\nkept to that.\n\nThey did find some traces of Peters. As Tom had said, the man was\ntoo prominent not to be noticed. He might have disguised himself,\nthough it seemed that the promoter was a proud man, and liked to\nbe seen in flashy clothes, a silk hat, and with a buttonhole\nbouquet.\n\nThis made it easy to get the first trace of him. He had been seen\nto take a train at the Shopton station, though he had not bought a\nticket. The promoter had paid his fare to Branchford, a junction\npoint, but there all trace of him was lost. It was not even\ncertain that he went there.\n\n\"He may have done that to throw us off,\" said Tom. \"Just because\nhe paid his way to Branchford, doesn't say he went there. He may\nhave gotten off at the next station beyond Shopton.\"\n\n\"Do you think he's still lingering around here?\" asked Ned.\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised,\" was Tom's answer. \"He knows that there\nis still some of the Damon property left, and he is probably\nhungry for that. We'll get him yet, Ned.\"\n\nBut at the end of several days Tom's hopes did not seem in a fair\nway to be realized. He and Ned followed one useless clue after\nanother. All the trails seemed blind ones. But Tom never gave up.\n\nHe was devoting all his time now to the finding of his friend Mr.\nDamon, and to the recovery of his fortune. In fact the latter was\nnot so important to Tom as was the former. For Mrs. Damon was on\nthe verge of a nervous collapse on account of the absence of her\nhusband.\n\n\"If I could only have some word from him, Tom!\" she cried,\nhelplessly.\n\nTo Tom the matter was very puzzling. It seemed utterly impossible\nthat Mr. Damon could be kept so close a prisoner that he could not\nmanage to get some word to his friends. It was not as if he was a\nchild. He was a man of more than ordinary abilities. Surely he\nmight find a way to outwit his enemies.\n\nBut the days passed, and no word came. A number of detectives had\nbeen employed, but they were no more successful than Tom. The\nlatter had given up his inventive work, for the time being, to\ndevote all his time to the solution of the mystery.\n\nTom and Ned had been away from Shopton for three days, following\nthe most promising clue they had yet received. But it had failed\nat the end, and one afternoon they found themselves in a small\ntown, about a hundred miles from Shopton. They had been motoring.\n\n\"I think I'll call up the house,\" said Tom. \"Dad may have received\nsome news, or Mrs. Damon may have sent him some word. I'll get my\nfather on the wire.\"\n\nConnection to Tom's house was soon made, and Ned, who was\nlistening to his chum's remarks, was startled to hear him cry out:\n\n\"What's that you say? My airship taken again? When did it happen?\nYes, I'm listening. Go on, Father!\"\n\nThen followed a silence while Tom listened, breaking in now and\nthen with an excited remark, Suddenly he called:\n\n\"Good-by, Dad! I'm coming right home!\"\n\nTom hung up the receiver with a bang, and turned to his chum.\n\n\"What do you think!\" he cried. \"The Eagle was taken again last\nnight! The same way as before. Nobody got a glimpse of the\nthieves, though. Dad has been trying to get in communication with\nme ever since. I'm glad I called up. Now we'll get right back to\nShopton, and see what we can do. This is the limit! Peters and his\ncrowd will be kidnapping us, next.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Ned.\n\nHe and Tom were soon off again, speeding in the auto toward\nShopton. But the roads were bad, after a heavy rain, and they did\nnot make fast time.\n\nThe coming of dusk found them with more than thirty miles to go.\nThey were in an almost deserted section of the country when\nsuddenly, as they were running slowly up a hill, there was a\nsudden crack, the auto gave a lurch to one side of the roadway and\nthen settled heavily. Tom clapped on both brakes quickly, and gave\na cry of dismay.\n\n\"Broken front axle!\" he said. \"We're dished, Ned!\"\n\nThey got out, being no more harmed than by the jolting. The car\nwas out of commission. The two chums looked around. Except for a\nlonely house, that bore every mark of being deserted, not a\ndwelling was in sight where they might ask for aid or shelter.\n\nAnd, as they looked, from that lonely house came a strange cry--a\ncry as though for help!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE AIRSHIP CAPTURE\n\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" cried Ned.\n\n\"I certainly did,\" answered Tom. \"What was it.\"\n\n\"Sounded to me like a cry of some sort.\"\n\n\"It was. An animal, I'd say.\"\n\nThe two chums moved away from the broken auto, and looked at each\nother. Then, by a common impulse, they started toward the lonely\nhouse, which was set back some distance from the road.\n\n\"Let's see who it was,\" suggested Tom, \"After all, though it looks\ndeserted, there may be someone in the house, and we've got to have\nsome kind of help. I don't want to leave my car on the road all\nnight, though it will have to be repaired before I can use it\nagain.\"\n\n\"It sure is a bad break,\" agreed Ned.\n\nAs they walked toward the deserted House they heard the strange\ncry again. It was louder this time, and following it the boys\nheard a sound as if a blow had been struck.\n\n\"Someone is being attacked!\" cried Tom. \"Maybe some poor tramp has\ntaken shelter in there and a dog is after them. Come on, Ned,\nwe've got to help!\"\n\nThey started on a run for the lonely house, but while still some\ndistance away a curious thing happened.\n\nThere was a sudden cry--an appeal for help it seemed--but this\ntime in the open. And, as Tom and Ned looked, they saw several men\nrunning from the rear of the old house. Between them they carried\nan inert form.\n\n\"Something's wrong!\" exclaimed Tom, \"There's crooked work going on\nhere, Ned.\"\n\n\"You're right! It's up to us to stop it! Come on!\"\n\nBut before the boys had taken half a dozen more steps they heard\nthat which caused them great surprise. For from a shed behind the\nhouse came the unmistakable throb and roar of a motor.\n\n\"They're going off in an auto!\" cried Ned.\n\n\"And they're carrying someone with them!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\nBy this time they had gotten to a point where they could see the\nshed, and what was their astonishment to see being rolled from it\na big biplane. At the sight of it Tom cried:\n\n\"It's the Eagle! That's my airship, Ned!\"\n\n\"You're right! How did it get here?\"\n\n\"That's for us to find out. I shouldn't wonder, Ned, but what\nwe're at last on the trail of Peters and his crowd!\"\n\nThe men--there were four or five of them, Ned guessed--now broke\ninto a run, still carrying among them the inert form of another.\nThe cries for help had ceased, and it seemed as if the unfortunate\none was unconscious.\n\nA moment later, and before the boys could do anything, had they\nthe power, the men fairly jumped aboard Tom Swift's biggest\nairship. The unconscious one was carried with them.\n\nThen the motor was speeded up. The roar and throbbing were almost\ndeafening.\n\n\"Stop that! Hold on! That's my machine!\" yelled Tom.\n\nHe might as well have spoken to the wind. With a rush and a roar\nthe big Eagle shot away and upward, carrying the men and their\nmysterious, unconscious companion. It was getting too dark for Tom\nand Ned to make out the forms or features of the strangers.\n\n\"We're too late!\" said Ned, hopelessly.\n\n\"Yes, they got away,\" agreed Tom. \"Oh, if only I had my speedy\nlittle monoplane!\"\n\n\"But who can they be? How did your airship get here? And who is\nthat man they carried out of the house?\" cried Ned.\n\n\"I don't know the last--maybe one of their crowd who was injured\nin a fight.\"\n\n\"What crowd?\"\n\n\"The Peters gang, of course. Can't you see it, Ned?\"\n\nUnable to do anything, the two youths watched the flight of the\nEagle. She did not move at her usual speed, for she was carrying\ntoo heavy a load.\n\nPresently from the air overhead, and slightly behind them, the\nboys heard the sound of another motor. They turned quickly.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Ned. \"Another airship, by all that's wonderful!\"\n\n\"If we could only stop them!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That's a big\nmachine, and they could take us aboard. Then we could chase the\nEagle. We could catch her, too, for she's overloaded!\"\n\nFrantically he and Tom waved their caps at the man who was now\nalmost overhead in his airship. The boys did not call. They well\nknew, with the noise of the motor, the occupant of the airship\ncould not hear them. But they waved and pointed to the slowly-moving\nEagle.\n\nTo their surprise and delight the man above them shut off his\nengine, and seemed about to come down. Then Tom cried, knowing he\ncould be heard:\n\n\"Help us capture that airship? It's mine and they've stolen it!\"\n\n\"All right! Be with you in a minute!\" came back the answer from\nabove.\n\nThe second biplane came down to earth, and as it ceased running\nalong on its bicycle wheels, the occupant jumped out.\n\n\"Hello, Tom Swift!\" he called, as he took off his goggles.\n\n\"Why--why it's Mr. Halling!\" cried the young inventor, in delight,\nrecognizing the birdman who had brought him the first news of Mr.\nDamon's trouble, the day the airship became entangled in the\naerials of the wireless on Tom's house.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Tom?\" asked Mr. Hailing. \"What has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"We're looking for Mr. Damon. That's a bad crowd there,\" and he\npointed toward the other aircraft. \"They have my Eagle. Can you\nhelp me catch them?\"\n\n\"I certainly can--and will! Get aboard! I can carry four.\"\n\n\"Then you have a new machine?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a dandy! All the latest improvements--self-starter and\nall! I'm glad of a chance to show it to you.\"\n\n\"And I'm glad, too!\" cried Tom. \"It was providential that you\nhappened along. What were you doing here?\"\n\n\"Just out on a trial spin. But come on, if we're going to catch\nthose fellows!\"\n\nQuickly Tom, Ned, and Mr. Halling climbed into the seats of the\nnew airship. It was started from a switch, and in a few seconds it\nwas on the wing, chasing after the Eagle.\n\nThen began a strange race, a race in the air after the unknown\nstrangers who had Tom's machine. Had the Eagle not been so heavily\nladen it might have escaped, for Tom's craft was a speedy one. But\nthis time it had to give the palm to Mr. Grant Halling's. Faster\nand faster in pursuit flew the Star, as the new craft was called.\nFaster and faster, until at last, coming directly over the Eagle,\nMr. Halling sent his craft down in such a manner as to \"blanket\"\nthe other. In an instant she began to sink, and with cries of\nalarm the men shut off the motor and started to volplane to the\nearth.\n\nBut they made an unskillful landing. The Eagle tilted to one side,\nand came down with a crash. There were cries of pain, then\nsilence, and a few seconds later two men ran away from the\ndisabled airship. But there were three senseless forms on the\nground beside the craft when Tom, Ned and Mr. Halling ran up. In\nthe fading light Tom saw a face he knew--three faces in fact.\n\n\"Mr. Damon!\" he cried. \"We've found him, Ned!\"\n\n\"But--too late--maybe!\" answered Ned, in a low voice, as he, too,\nrecognized the man who had been missing so long.\n\nMr. Halling was bending over the unconscious form of his friend.\n\n\"He's alive!\" he cried, joyfully. \"And not much hurt, either. But\nhe has been ill, and looks half starved. Who are these men?\"\n\nTom gave a hasty look.\n\n\"Shallock Peters and Harrison Boylan!\" he cried. \"Ned, at last\nwe've caught the scoundrels!\"\n\nIt was true. Chance had played into the hands of Tom Swift. While\nMr. Halling was looking after Mr. Damon, reviving him, the young\ninventor and Ned quickly bound the hands and feet of the two\nplotters with pieces of wire from the broken airship.\n\nPresently Mr. Damon opened his eyes.\n\n\"Where am I? What happened? Oh, bless my watch chain--it's Tom\nSwift! Bless my cigar case, I--\"\n\n\"He's all right!\" cried Tom, joyfully. \"When Mr. Damon blesses\nsomething beside his tombstone he's all right.\"\n\nPeters and Boylan soon revived, both being merely stunned, as was\nMr. Damon. They looked about in wonder, and then, feeling that\nthey were prisoners, resigned themselves to their fate. Both men\nwere shabbily dressed, and Tom would hardly have known the once\nspick and span Mr. Peters. He had no rose in his buttonhole now.\n\n\"Well, you have me, I see,\" he said, coolly. \"I was afraid we were\nplaying for too high a stake.\"\n\n\"Yes, we've got you,\" replied Tom,\n\n\"But you can't prove much against me,\" went on Peters. \"I'll deny\neverything.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" added the young inventor, grimly, and\nthought of the picture in the plate and the record on the wax\ncylinder.\n\n\"We've got to get Mr. Damon to some place where he can be looked\nafter,\" broke in Mr. Halling. \"Then we'll hear the story.\"\n\nA passing farmer was prevailed on to take the party in his big\nwagon to the nearest town, Mr. Hailing going on ahead in his\nairship. Tom's craft could not be moved, being badly damaged.\n\nOnce in town Peters and Boylan were put in jail, on the charges\nfor which Tom carried warrants. Mr. Damon was taken to a hotel and\na doctor summoned. It was as Mr. Halling had guessed. His friend\nhad been ill, and so weak that he could not get out of bed. It was\nthis that enabled the plotters to so easily keep him a prisoner.\n\nBy degrees Mr. Damon told his story. He had rashly allowed Peters\nto get control of most of his fortune, and, in a vain hope of\ngetting back some of his losses, had, one night--the night he\ndisappeared, in fact--agreed to meet Peters and some of his men to\ntalk matters over. Of this Mr. Damon said nothing to his wife.\n\nHe went out that night to meet Peters in the garden, but the\nplotters had changed their plans. They boldly kidnapped their\nvictim, chloroformed him and took him away in Tom's airship, which\nBoylan and some of his tools daringly stole a short time\npreviously. Later they returned it, as they had no use for it at\nthe lonely house.\n\nMr. Damon was taken to the house, and there kept a prisoner. The\nmen hoped to prevail on the fears of his wife to make her give up\nthe valuable property. But we have seen how Tom foiled Peters.\n\nThe experience of Mr. Damon, coupled with rough treatment he\nreceived, and lack of good food, soon made him ill. He was so weak\nthat he could not help himself, and with that he was kept under\nguard. So he had no chance to escape or send his wife or friends\nany word.\n\n\"But I'm all right now, Tom, thanks to you!\" said he. \"Bless my\npocketbook, I don't care if my fortune is lost, as long as I'm\nalive and can get back to my wife.\"\n\n\"But I don't believe your fortune will be lost,\" said Tom. \"I\nthink I have the picture and other evidence that will save it,\"\nand he told of his photo telephone, and of what it had accomplished.\n\n\"Bless my eyelashes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What a young man you are,\nTom Swift!\"\n\nTom smiled gladly. He knew now that his old friend was himself\nonce more.\n\nThere is little left to tell. Chance had aided Tom in a most\nwonderful way--chance and the presence of Mr. Halling with his\nairship at just the right moment.\n\nTom made a diligent effort to find out who it was that had\nchloroformed him in the telephone booth that time, but learned\nnothing definite. Peters and Boylan were both examined as to this\non their trials, but denied it, and the young inventor was forced\nto conclude that it must have been some of the unscrupulous men\nwho had taken his father's patent some time before.\n\n\"They may have heard of your prosperity, and thought it a good\nchance to rob you,\" suggested Ned.\n\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Tom. \"Well, we'll let it go at that. Only I hope\nthey don't come again.\"\n\nMr. Damon was soon home with his wife again, and Peters and Boylan\nwere held in heavy bail. They had secreted most of Mr. Damon's\nwealth, falsely telling him it was lost, and they were forced to\ngive back his fortune. The evidence against them was clear and\nconclusive. When Tom went into court with his phonograph record of\nthe talk of Peters, even though the man's voice was hoarse from a\ncold when he talked, and when his picture was shown, in the\ntelephone booth, the jury at once convicted him.\n\nBoylan, when he learned of the missing button in Tom's possession,\nconfessed that he and some of his men who were birdmen had taken\nTom's airship. They wanted a means of getting Mr. Damon to the\nlonely house without being traced, and they accomplished it.\n\nAs Tom had surmised, Peters had become suspicious after his last\ntalk with Mrs. Damon, and had fled. He disguised himself and went\ninto hiding with the others at the lonely house. Then he learned\nthat the authorities of another city, where he had swindled many,\nwere on his trail, and he decided to decamp with his gang, taking\nMr. Damon with them. For this purpose Tom's airship was taken the\nsecond time, and a wholesale escape, with Mr. Damon a prisoner,\nwas planned.\n\nBut fate was against the plotters. Two of them did manage to get\naway, but they were not really wanted. The big fish were Peters\nand Boylan, and they were securely caught in the net of the law.\nPeters was greatly surprised when he learned of Tom's trap, and of\nthe photo telephone. He had no idea he had been incriminating\nhimself when he talked over the wire.\n\n\"Well, it's all over,\" remarked Ned to Tom, one day, when the\ndisabled auto and the airship had been brought home and repaired.\n\"The plotters are in prison for long terms, and Mr. Damon is\nfound, together with his fortune. The photo telephone did it,\nTom.\"\n\n\"Not all of it--but a good bit,\" admitted the young inventor, with\na smile.\n\n\"What are you going to do next, Tom?\"\n\n\"I hardly know. I think--\"\n\nBefore Tom could finish, a voice was heard in the hall outside the\nlibrary.\n\n\"Bless my overshoes! Where's Tom? I want to thank him again for\nwhat he did for me,\" and Mr. Damon, now fully recovered, came in.\n\"Bless my suspender button, but it's good to be alive, Tom!\" he\ncried.\n\n\"It certainly is,\" agreed Tom. \"And the next time you go for a\nconference with such men as Peters, look out for airships.\"\n\n\"I will, Tom, I will!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my watch chain,\nI will!\"\n\nAnd now, for a time, we will say good-bye to Tom Swift, leaving\nhim to perfect his other inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom Swift and his Photo Telephone, by\nVictor Appleton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SWIFT AND HIS PHOTO TELEPHONE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4532.txt or 4532.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/4/5/3/4532/\n\nProduced by Robert Rowe, Charles Franks and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Before it lay a plain, not very great, but which was, as\nit were, an isle in the sea of woodland, since even when you stood on the\nflat ground, you could see trees everywhere in the offing, though as for\nhills, you could scarce say that there were any; only swellings-up of the\nearth here and there, like the upheavings of the water that one sees at\nwhiles going on amidst the eddies of a swift but deep stream.\n\nOn either side, to right and left the tree-girdle reached out toward the\nblue distance, thick close and unsundered, save where it and the plain\nwhich it begirdled was cleft amidmost by a river about as wide as the\nThames at Sheene when the flood-tide is at its highest, but so swift and\nfull of eddies, that it gave token of mountains not so far distant,\nthough they were hidden.  On each side moreover of the stream of this\nriver was a wide space of stones, great and little, and in most places\nabove this stony waste were banks of a few feet high, showing where the\nyearly winter flood was most commonly stayed.\n\nYou must know that this great clearing in the woodland was not a matter\nof haphazard; though the river had driven a road whereby men might fare\non each side of its hurrying stream.  It was men who had made that Isle\nin the woodland.\n\nFor many generations the folk that now dwelt there had learned the craft\nof iron-founding, so that they had no lack of wares of iron and steel,\nwhether they were tools of handicraft or weapons for hunting and for war.\nIt was the men of the Folk, who coming adown by the river-side had made\nthat clearing.  The tale tells not whence they came, but belike from the\ndales of the distant mountains, and from dales and mountains and plains\nfurther aloof and yet further.\n\nAnyhow they came adown the river; on its waters on rafts, by its shores\nin wains or bestriding their horses or their kine, or afoot, till they\nhad a mind to abide; and there as it fell they stayed their travel, and\nspread from each side of the river, and fought with the wood and its wild\nthings, that they might make to themselves a dwelling-place on the face\nof the earth.\n\nSo they cut down the trees, and burned their stumps that the grass might\ngrow sweet for their kine and sheep and horses; and they diked the river\nwhere need was all through the plain, and far up into the wild-wood to\nbridle the winter floods: and they made them boats to ferry them over,\nand to float down stream and track up-stream: they fished the river's\neddies also with net and with line; and drew drift from out of it of far-\ntravelled wood and other matters; and the gravel of its shallows they\nwashed for gold; and it became their friend, and they loved it, and gave\nit a name, and called it the Dusky, and the Glassy, and the\nMirkwood-water; for the names of it changed with the generations of man.\n\nThere then in the clearing of the wood that for many years grew greater\nyearly they drave their beasts to pasture in the new-made meadows, where\nyear by year the grass grew sweeter as the sun shone on it and the\nstanding waters went from it; and now in the year whereof the tale\ntelleth it was a fair and smiling plain, and no folk might have a better\nmeadow.\n\nBut long before that had they learned the craft of tillage and taken heed\nto the acres and begun to grow wheat and rye thereon round about their\nroofs; the spade came into their hands, and they bethought them of the\nplough-share, and the tillage spread and grew, and there was no lack of\nbread.\n\nIn such wise that Folk had made an island amidst of the Mirkwood, and\nestablished a home there, and upheld it with manifold toil too long to\ntell of.  And from the beginning this clearing in the wood they called\nthe Mid-mark: for you shall know that men might journey up and down the\nMirkwood-water, and half a day's ride up or down they would come on\nanother clearing or island in the woods, and these were the Upper-mark\nand the Nether-mark: and all these three were inhabited by men of one\nfolk and one kindred, which was called the Mark-men, though of many\nbranches was that stem of folk, who bore divers signs in battle and at\nthe council whereby they might be known.\n\nNow in the Mid-mark itself were many Houses of men; for by that word had\nthey called for generations those who dwelt together under one token of\nkinship.  The river ran from South to North, and both on the East side\nand on the West were there Houses of the Folk, and their habitations were\nshouldered up nigh unto the wood, so that ever betwixt them and the river\nwas there a space of tillage and pasture.\n\nTells the tale of one such House, whose habitations were on the west side\nof the water, on a gentle slope of land, so that no flood higher than\ncommon might reach them.  It was straight down to the river mostly that\nthe land fell off, and on its downward-reaching slopes was the tillage,\n\"the Acres,\" as the men of that time always called tilled land; and\nbeyond that was the meadow going fair and smooth, though with here and\nthere a rising in it, down to the lips of the stony waste of the winter\nriver.\n\nNow the name of this House was the Wolfings, and they bore a Wolf on\ntheir banners, and their warriors were marked on the breast with the\nimage of the Wolf, that they might be known for what they were if they\nfell in battle, and were stripped.\n\nThe house, that is to say the Roof, of the Wolfings of the Mid-mark stood\non the topmost of the slope aforesaid with its back to the wild-wood and\nits face to the acres and the water.  But you must know that in those\ndays the men of one branch of kindred dwelt under one roof together, and\nhad therein their place and dignity; nor were there many degrees amongst\nthem as hath befallen afterwards, but all they of one blood were brethren\nand of equal dignity.  Howbeit they had servants or thralls, men taken in\nbattle, men of alien blood, though true it is that from time to time were\nsome of such men taken into the House, and hailed as brethren of the\nblood.\n\nAlso (to make an end at once of these matters of kinship and affinity)\nthe men of one House might not wed the women of their own House: to the\nWolfing men all Wolfing women were as sisters: they must needs wed with\nthe Hartings or the Elkings or the Bearings, or other such Houses of the\nMark as were not so close akin to the blood of the Wolf; and this was a\nlaw that none dreamed of breaking.  Thus then dwelt this Folk and such\nwas their Custom.\n\nAs to the Roof of the Wolfings, it was a great hall and goodly, after the\nfashion of their folk and their day; not built of stone and lime, but\nframed of the goodliest trees of the wild-wood squared with the adze, and\nbetwixt the framing filled with clay wattled with reeds.  Long was that\nhouse, and at one end anigh the gable was the Man's-door, not so high\nthat a man might stand on the threshold and his helmcrest clear the\nlintel; for such was the custom, that a tall man must bow himself as he\ncame into the hall; which custom maybe was a memory of the days of\nonslaught when the foemen were mostly wont to beset the hall; whereas in\nthe days whereof the tale tells they drew out into the fields and fought\nunfenced; unless at whiles when the odds were over great, and then they\ndrew their wains about them and were fenced by the wain-burg.  At least\nit was from no niggardry that the door was made thus low, as might be\nseen by the fair and manifold carving of knots and dragons that was\nwrought above the lintel of the door for some three foot's space.  But a\nlike door was there anigh the other gable-end, whereby the women entered,\nand it was called the Woman's-door.\n\nNear to the house on all sides except toward the wood were there many\nbowers and cots round about the penfolds and the byres: and these were\nbooths for the stowage of wares, and for crafts and smithying that were\nunhandy to do in the house; and withal they were the dwelling-places of\nthe thralls.  And the lads and young men often abode there many days and\nwere cherished there of the thralls that loved them, since at whiles they\nshunned the Great Roof that they might be the freer to come and go at\ntheir pleasure, and deal as they would.  Thus was there a clustering on\nthe slopes and bents betwixt the acres of the Wolfings and the wild-wood\nwherein dwelt the wolves.\n\nAs to the house within, two rows of pillars went down it endlong,\nfashioned of the mightiest trees that might be found, and each one fairly\nwrought with base and chapiter, and wreaths and knots, and fighting men\nand dragons; so that it was like a church of later days that has a nave\nand aisles: windows there were above the aisles, and a passage underneath\nthe said windows in their roofs.  In the aisles were the sleeping-places\nof the Folk, and down the nave under the crown of the roof were three\nhearths for the fires, and above each hearth a luffer or smoke-bearer to\ndraw the smoke up when the fires were lighted.  Forsooth on a bright\nwinter afternoon it was strange to see the three columns of smoke going\nwavering up to the dimness of the mighty roof, and one maybe smitten\nathwart by the sunbeams.  As for the timber of the roof itself and its\nframing, so exceeding great and high it was, that the tale tells how that\nnone might see the fashion of it from the hall-floor unless he were to\nraise aloft a blazing faggot on a long pole: since no lack of timber was\nthere among the men of the Mark.\n\nAt the end of the hall anigh the Man's-door was the dais, and a table\nthereon set thwartwise of the hall; and in front of the dais was the\nnoblest and greatest of the hearths; (but of the others one was in the\nvery midmost, and another in the Woman's-Chamber) and round about the\ndais, along the gable-wall, and hung from pillar to pillar were woven\ncloths pictured with images of ancient tales and the deeds of the\nWolfings, and the deeds of the Gods from whence they came.  And this was\nthe fairest place of all the house and the best-beloved of the Folk, and\nespecially of the older and the mightier men: and there were tales told,\nand songs sung, especially if they were new: and thereto also were\nmessengers brought if any tidings were abroad: there also would the\nelders talk together about matters concerning the House or the Mid-mark\nor the whole Folk of the Markmen.\n\nYet you must not think that their solemn councils were held there, the\nfolk-motes whereat it must be determined what to do and what to forbear\ndoing; for according as such councils, (which they called Things) were of\nthe House or of the Mid-mark or of the whole Folk, were they held each at\nthe due Thing-steads in the Wood aloof from either acre or meadow, (as\nwas the custom of our forefathers for long after) and at such Things\nwould all the men of the House or the Mid-mark or the Folk be present man\nby man.  And in each of these steads was there a Doomring wherein Doom\nwas given by the neighbours chosen, (whom now we call the Jury) in\nmatters between man and man; and no such doom of neighbours was given,\nand no such voice of the Folk proclaimed in any house or under any roof,\nnor even as aforesaid on the tilled acres or the depastured meadows.  This\nwas the custom of our forefathers, in memory, belike, of the days when as\nyet there was neither house nor tillage, nor flocks and herds, but the\nEarth's face only and what freely grew thereon.\n\nBut over the dais there hung by chains and pulleys fastened to a tie-beam\nof the roof high aloft a wondrous lamp fashioned of glass; yet of no such\nglass as the folk made then and there, but of a fair and clear green like\nan emerald, and all done with figures and knots in gold, and strange\nbeasts, and a warrior slaying a dragon, and the sun rising on the earth:\nnor did any tale tell whence this lamp came, but it was held as an\nancient and holy thing by all the Markmen, and the kindred of the Wolf\nhad it in charge to keep a light burning in it night and day for ever;\nand they appointed a maiden of their own kindred to that office; which\ndamsel must needs be unwedded, since no wedded woman dwelling under that\nroof could be a Wolfing woman, but would needs be of the houses wherein\nthe Wolfings wedded.\n\nThis lamp which burned ever was called the Hall-Sun, and the woman who\nhad charge of it, and who was the fairest that might be found was called\nafter it the Hall-Sun also.\n\nAt the other end of the hall was the Woman's-Chamber, and therein were\nthe looms and other gear for the carding and spinning of wool and the\nweaving of cloth.\n\nSuch was the Roof under which dwelt the kindred of the Wolfings; and the\nother kindreds of the Mid-mark had roofs like to it; and of these the\nchiefest were the Elkings, the Vallings, the Alftings, the Beamings, the\nGaltings, and the Bearings; who bore on their banners the Elk, the\nFalcon, the Swan, the Tree, the Boar, and the Bear.  But other lesser and\nnewer kindreds there were than these: as for the Hartings above named,\nthey were a kindred of the Upper-mark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE FLITTING OF THE WAR-ARROW\n\n\nTells the tale that it was an evening of summer, when the wheat was in\nthe ear, but yet green; and the neat-herds were done driving the milch-\nkine to the byre, and the horseherds and the shepherds had made the night-\nshift, and the out-goers were riding two by two and one by one through\nthe lanes between the wheat and the rye towards the meadow.  Round the\ncots of the thralls were gathered knots of men and women both thralls and\nfreemen, some talking together, some hearkening a song or a tale, some\nsinging and some dancing together; and the children gambolling about from\ngroup to group with their shrill and tuneless voices, like young\nthrostles who have not yet learned the song of their race.  With these\nwere mingled dogs, dun of colour, long of limb, sharp-nosed, gaunt and\ngreat; they took little heed of the children as they pulled them about in\ntheir play, but lay down, or loitered about, as though they had forgotten\nthe chase and the wild-wood.\n\nMerry was the folk with that fair tide, and the promise of the harvest,\nand the joy of life, and there was no weapon among them so close to the\nhouses, save here and there the boar-spear of some herdman or herd-woman\nlate come from the meadow.\n\nTall and for the most part comely were both men and women; the most of\nthem light-haired and grey-eyed, with cheek-bones somewhat high; white of\nskin but for the sun's burning, and the wind's parching, and whereas they\nwere tanned of a very ruddy and cheerful hue.  But the thralls were some\nof them of a shorter and darker breed, black-haired also and dark-eyed,\nlighter of limb; sometimes better knit, but sometimes crookeder of leg\nand knottier of arm.  But some also were of build and hue not much unlike\nto the freemen; and these doubtless came of some other Folk of the Goths\nwhich had given way in battle before the Men of the Mark, either they or\ntheir fathers.\n\nMoreover some of the freemen were unlike their fellows and kindred, being\nslenderer and closer-knit, and black-haired, but grey-eyed withal; and\namongst these were one or two who exceeded in beauty all others of the\nHouse.\n\nNow the sun was set and the glooming was at point to begin and the\nshadowless twilight lay upon the earth.  The nightingales on the borders\nof the wood sang ceaselessly from the scattered hazel-trees above the\ngreensward where the grass was cropped down close by the nibbling of the\nrabbits; but in spite of their song and the divers voices of the men-folk\nabout the houses, it was an evening on which sounds from aloof can be\nwell heard, since noises carry far at such tides.\n\nSuddenly they who were on the edges of those throngs and were the less\nnoisy, held themselves as if to listen; and a group that had gathered\nabout a minstrel to hear his story fell hearkening also round about the\nsilenced and hearkening tale-teller: some of the dancers and singers\nnoted them and in their turn stayed the dance and kept silence to\nhearken; and so from group to group spread the change, till all were\nstraining their ears to hearken the tidings.  Already the men of the\nnight-shift had heard it, and the shepherds of them had turned about, and\nwere trotting smartly back through the lanes of the tall wheat: but the\nhorse-herds were now scarce seen on the darkening meadow, as they\ngalloped on fast toward their herds to drive home the stallions.  For\nwhat they had heard was the tidings of war.\n\nThere was a sound in the air as of a humble-bee close to the ear of one\nlying on a grassy bank; or whiles as of a cow afar in the meadow lowing\nin the afternoon when milking-time draws nigh: but it was ever shriller\nthan the one, and fuller than the other; for it changed at whiles, though\nafter the first sound of it, it did not rise or fall, because the eve was\nwindless.  You might hear at once that for all it was afar, it was a\ngreat and mighty sound; nor did any that hearkened doubt what it was, but\nall knew it for the blast of the great war-horn of the Elkings, whose\nRoof lay up Mirkwood-water next to the Roof of the Wolfings.\n\nSo those little throngs broke up at once; and all the freemen, and of the\nthralls a good many, flocked, both men and women, to the Man's-door of\nthe hall, and streamed in quietly and with little talk, as men knowing\nthat they should hear all in due season.\n\nWithin under the Hall-Sun, amidst the woven stories of time past, sat the\nelders and chief warriors on the dais, and amidst of all a big strong man\nof forty winters, his dark beard a little grizzled, his eyes big and\ngrey.  Before him on the board lay the great War-horn of the Wolfings\ncarved out of the tusk of a sea-whale of the North and with many devices\non it and the Wolf amidst them all; its golden mouth-piece and rim\nwrought finely with flowers.  There it abode the blowing, until the\nspoken word of some messenger should set forth the tidings borne on the\nair by the horn of the Elkings.\n\nBut the name of the dark-haired chief was Thiodolf (to wit Folk-wolf) and\nhe was deemed the wisest man of the Wolfings, and the best man of his\nhands, and of heart most dauntless.  Beside him sat the fair woman called\nthe Hall-Sun; for she was his foster-daughter before men's eyes; and she\nwas black-haired and grey-eyed like to her fosterer, and never was woman\nfashioned fairer: she was young of years, scarce twenty winters old.\n\nThere sat the chiefs and elders on the dais, and round about stood the\nkindred intermingled with the thralls, and no man spake, for they were\nawaiting sure and certain tidings: and when all were come in who had a\nmind to, there was so great a silence in the hall, that the song of the\nnightingales on the wood-edge sounded clear and loud therein, and even\nthe chink of the bats about the upper windows could be heard.  Then\namidst the hush of men-folk, and the sounds of the life of the earth came\nanother sound that made all turn their eyes toward the door; and this was\nthe pad-pad of one running on the trodden and summer-dried ground anigh\nthe hall: it stopped for a moment at the Man's-door, and the door opened,\nand the throng parted, making way for the man that entered and came\nhastily up to the midst of the table that stood on the dais athwart the\nhall, and stood there panting, holding forth in his outstretched hand\nsomething which not all could see in the dimness of the hall-twilight,\nbut which all knew nevertheless.  The man was young, lithe and slender,\nand had no raiment but linen breeches round his middle, and skin shoes on\nhis feet.  As he stood there gathering his breath for speech, Thiodolf\nstood up, and poured mead into a drinking horn and held it out towards\nthe new-comer, and spake, but in rhyme and measure:\n\n   \"Welcome, thou evening-farer, and holy be thine head,\n   Since thou hast sought unto us in the heart of the Wolfings' stead;\n   Drink now of the horn of the mighty, and call a health if thou wilt\n   O'er the eddies of the mead-horn to the washing out of guilt.\n   For thou com'st to the peace of the Wolfings, and our very guest thou\n   art,\n   And meseems as I behold thee, that I look on a child of the Hart.\"\n\nBut the man put the horn from him with a hasty hand, and none said\nanother word to him until he had gotten his breath again; and then he\nsaid:\n\n   \"All hail ye Wood-Wolfs' children! nought may I drink the wine,\n   For the mouth and the maw that I carry this eve are nought of mine;\n   And my feet are the feet of the people, since the word went forth that\n   tide,\n   'O Elf here of the Hartings, no longer shalt thou bide\n   In any house of the Markmen than to speak the word and wend,\n   Till all men know the tidings and thine errand hath an end.'\n   Behold, O Wolves, the token and say if it be true!\n   I bear the shaft of battle that is four-wise cloven through,\n   And its each end dipped in the blood-stream, both the iron and the\n   horn,\n   And its midmost scathed with the fire; and the word that I have borne\n   Along with this war-token is, 'Wolfings of the Mark\n   Whenso ye see the war-shaft, by the daylight or the dark,\n   Busk ye to battle faring, and leave all work undone\n   Save the gathering for the handplay at the rising of the sun.\n   Three days hence is the hosting, and thither bear along\n   Your wains and your kine for the slaughter lest the journey should be\n   long.\n   For great is the Folk, saith the tidings, that against the Markmen\n   come;\n   In a far off land is their dwelling, whenso they sit at home,\n   And Welsh {1} is their tongue, and we wot not of the word that is in\n   their mouth,\n   As they march a many together from the cities of the South.'\"\n\nTherewith he held up yet for a minute the token of the war-arrow ragged\nand burnt and bloody; and turning about with it in his hand went his ways\nthrough the open door, none hindering; and when he was gone, it was as if\nthe token were still in the air there against the heads of the living\nmen, and the heads of the woven warriors, so intently had all gazed at\nit; and none doubted the tidings or the token.  Then said Thiodolf:\n\n   \"Forth will we Wolfing children, and cast a sound abroad:\n   The mouth of the sea-beast's weapon shall speak the battle-word;\n   And ye warriors hearken and hasten, and dight the weed of war,\n   And then to acre and meadow wend ye adown no more,\n   For this work shall be for the women to drive our neat from the mead,\n   And to yoke the wains, and to load them as the men of war have need.\"\n\nOut then they streamed from the hall, and no man was left therein save\nthe fair Hall-Sun sitting under the lamp whose name she bore.  But to the\nhighest of the slope they went, where was a mound made higher by man's\nhandiwork; thereon stood Thiodolf and handled the horn, turning his face\ntoward the downward course of Mirkwood-water; and he set the horn to his\nlips, and blew a long blast, and then again, and yet again the third\ntime; and all the sounds of the gathering night were hushed under the\nsound of the roaring of the war-horn of the Wolfings; and the Kin of the\nBeamings heard it as they sat in their hall, and they gat them ready to\nhearken to the bearer of the tidings who should follow on the sound of\nthe war-blast.\n\nBut when the last sound of the horn had died away, then said Thiodolf:\n\n   \"Now Wolfing children hearken, what the splintered War-shaft saith,\n   The fire scathed blood-stained aspen! we shall ride for life or death,\n   We warriors, a long journey with the herd and with the wain;\n   But unto this our homestead shall we wend us back again,\n   All the gleanings of the battle; and here for them that live\n   Shall stand the Roof of the Wolfings, and for them shall the meadow\n   thrive,\n   And the acres give their increase in the harvest of the year;\n   Now is no long departing since the Hall-Sun bideth here\n   'Neath the holy Roof of the Fathers, and the place of the Wolfing kin,\n   And the feast of our glad returning shall yet be held therein.\n   Hear the bidding of the War-shaft!  All men, both thralls and free,\n   'Twixt twenty winters and sixty, beneath the shield shall be,\n   And the hosting is at the Thing-stead, the Upper-mark anigh;\n   And we wend away to-morrow ere the Sun is noon-tide high.\"\n\nTherewith he stepped down from the mound, and went his way back to the\nhall; and manifold talk arose among the folk; and of the warriors some\nwere already dight for the journey, but most not, and a many went their\nways to see to their weapons and horses, and the rest back again into the\nhall.\n\nBy this time night had fallen, and between then and the dawning would be\nno darker hour, for the moon was just rising; a many of the horse-herds\nhad done their business, and were now making their way back again through\nthe lanes of the wheat, driving the stallions before them, who played\ntogether kicking, biting and squealing, paying but little heed to the\nstanding corn on either side.  Lights began to glitter now in the cots of\nthe thralls, and brighter still in the stithies where already you might\nhear the hammers clinking on the anvils, as men fell to looking to their\nbattle gear.\n\nBut the chief men and the women sat under their Roof on the eve of\ndeparture: and the tuns of mead were broached, and the horns filled and\nborne round by young maidens, and men ate and drank and were merry; and\nfrom time to time as some one of the warriors had done with giving heed\nto his weapons, he entered into the hall and fell into the company of\nthose whom he loved most and by whom he was best beloved; and whiles they\ntalked, and whiles they sang to the harp up and down that long house; and\nthe moon risen high shone in at the windows, and there was much laughter\nand merriment, and talk of deeds of arms of the old days on the eve of\nthat departure: till little by little weariness fell on them, and they\nwent their ways to slumber, and the hall was fallen silent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THIODOLF TALKETH WITH THE WOOD-SUN\n\n\nBut yet sat Thiodolf under the Hall-Sun for a while as one in deep\nthought; till at last as he stirred, his sword clattered on him; and then\nhe lifted up his eyes and looked down the hall and saw no man stirring,\nso he stood up and settled his raiment on him, and went forth, and so\ntook his ways through the hall-door, as one who hath an errand.\n\nThe moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without, and the dew was\nfalling in the coldest hour of the night, and the earth smelled sweetly:\nthe whole habitation was asleep now, and there was no sound to be known\nas the sound of any creature, save that from the distant meadow came the\nlowing of a cow that had lost her calf, and that a white owl was flitting\nabout near the eaves of the Roof with her wild cry that sounded like the\nmocking of merriment now silent.\n\nThiodolf turned toward the wood, and walked steadily through the\nscattered hazel-trees, and thereby into the thick of the beech-trees,\nwhose boles grew smooth and silver-grey, high and close-set: and so on\nand on he went as one going by a well-known path, though there was no\npath, till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the\nbeech-leaves, though yet for all the darkness, no man could go there and\nnot feel that the roof was green above him.  Still he went on in despite\nof the darkness, till at last there was a glimmer before him, that grew\ngreater till he came unto a small wood-lawn whereon the turf grew again,\nthough the grass was but thin, because little sunlight got to it, so\nclose and thick were the tall trees round about it.  In the heavens above\nit by now there was a light that was not all of the moon, though it might\nscarce be told whether that light were the memory of yesterday or the\npromise of to-morrow, since little of the heavens could be seen thence,\nsave the crown of them, because of the tall tree-tops.\n\nNought looked Thiodolf either at the heavens above, or the trees, as he\nstrode from off the husk-strewn floor of the beech wood on to the scanty\ngrass of the lawn, but his eyes looked straight before him at that which\nwas amidmost of the lawn: and little wonder was that; for there on a\nstone chair sat a woman exceeding fair, clad in glittering raiment, her\nhair lying as pale in the moonlight on the grey stone as the barley acres\nin the August night before the reaping-hook goes in amongst them.  She\nsat there as though she were awaiting someone, and he made no stop nor\nstay, but went straight up to her, and took her in his arms, and kissed\nher mouth and her eyes, and she him again; and then he sat himself down\nbeside her.  But her eyes looked kindly on him as she said:\n\n\"O Thiodolf, hardy art thou, that thou hast no fear to take me in thine\narms and to kiss me, as though thou hadst met in the meadow with a maiden\nof the Elkings: and I, who am a daughter of the Gods of thy kindred, and\na Chooser of the Slain!  Yea, and that upon the eve of battle and the\ndawn of thy departure to the stricken field!\"\n\n\"O Wood-Sun,\" he said \"thou art the treasure of life that I found when I\nwas young, and the love of life that I hold, now that my beard is\ngrizzling.  Since when did I fear thee, Wood-Sun?  Did I fear thee when\nfirst I saw thee, and we stood amidst the hazelled field, we twain living\namongst the slain?  But my sword was red with the blood of the foe, and\nmy raiment with mine own blood; and I was a-weary with the day's work,\nand sick with many strokes, and methought I was fainting into death.  And\nthere thou wert before me, full of life and ruddy and smiling both lips\nand eyes; thy raiment clean and clear, thine hands stained with blood:\nthen didst thou take me by my bloody and weary hand, and didst kiss my\nlips grown ashen pale, and thou saidst 'Come with me.'  And I strove to\ngo, and might not; so many and sore were my hurts.  Then amidst my\nsickness and my weariness was I merry; for I said to myself, This is the\ndeath of the warrior, and it is exceeding sweet.  What meaneth it?  Folk\nsaid of me; he is over young to meet the foeman; yet am I not over young\nto die?\"\n\nTherewith he laughed out amid the wild-wood, and his speech became song,\nand he said:\n\n   \"We wrought in the ring of the hazels, and the wine of war we drank:\n   From the tide when the sun stood highest to the hour wherein she sank:\n   And three kings came against me, the mightiest of the Huns,\n   The evil-eyed in battle, the swift-foot wily ones;\n   And they gnashed their teeth against me, and they gnawed on the shield-\n   rims there,\n   On that afternoon of summer, in the high-tide of the year.\n   Keen-eyed I gazed about me, and I saw the clouds draw up\n   Till the heavens were dark as the hollow of a wine-stained iron cup,\n   And the wild-deer lay unfeeding on the grass of the forest glades,\n   And all earth was scared with the thunder above our clashing blades.\n\n   \"Then sank a King before me, and on fell the other twain,\n   And I tossed up the reddened sword-blade in the gathered rush of the\n   rain\n   And the blood and the water blended, and fragrant grew the earth.\n\n   \"There long I turned and twisted within the battle-girth\n   Before those bears of onset: while out from the grey world streamed\n   The broad red lash of the lightening and in our byrnies gleamed.\n   And long I leapt and laboured in that garland of the fight\n   'Mid the blue blades and the lightening; but ere the sky grew light\n   The second of the Hun-kings on the rain-drenched daisies lay;\n   And we twain with the battle blinded a little while made stay,\n   And leaning on our sword-hilts each on the other gazed.\n\n   \"Then the rain grew less, and one corner of the veil of clouds was\n   raised,\n   And as from the broidered covering gleams out the shoulder white\n   Of the bed-mate of the warrior when on his wedding night\n   He layeth his hand to the linen; so, down there in the west\n   Gleamed out the naked heaven: but the wrath rose up in my breast,\n   And the sword in my hand rose with it, and I leaped and hewed at the\n   Hun;\n   And from him too flared the war-flame, and the blades danced bright in\n   the sun\n   Come back to the earth for a little before the ending of day.\n\n   \"There then with all that was in him did the Hun play out the play,\n   Till he fell, and left me tottering, and I turned my feet to wend\n   To the place of the mound of the mighty, the gate of the way without\n   end.\n   And there thou wert.  How was it, thou Chooser of the Slain,\n   Did I die in thine arms, and thereafter did thy mouth-kiss wake me\n   again?\"\n\nEre the last sound of his voice was done she turned and kissed him; and\nthen she said; \"Never hadst thou a fear and thine heart is full of\nhardihood.\"\n\nThen he said:\n\n   \"'Tis the hardy heart, beloved, that keepeth me alive,\n   As the king-leek in the garden by the rain and the sun doth thrive,\n   So I thrive by the praise of the people; it is blent with my drink and\n   my meat;\n   As I slumber in the night-tide it laps me soft and sweet;\n   And through the chamber window when I waken in the morn\n   With the wind of the sun's arising from the meadow is it borne\n   And biddeth me remember that yet I live on earth:\n   Then I rise and my might is with me, and fills my heart with mirth,\n   As I think of the praise of the people; and all this joy I win\n   By the deeds that my heart commandeth and the hope that lieth\n   therein.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"but day runneth ever on the heels of day, and there are\nmany and many days; and betwixt them do they carry eld.\"\n\n\"Yet art thou no older than in days bygone,\" said he.  \"Is it so, O\nDaughter of the Gods, that thou wert never born, but wert from before the\nframing of the mountains, from the beginning of all things?\"\n\nBut she said:\n\n   \"Nay, nay; I began, I was born; although it may be indeed\n   That not on the hills of the earth I sprang from the godhead's seed.\n   And e'en as my birth and my waxing shall be my waning and end.\n   But thou on many an errand, to many a field dost wend\n   Where the bow at adventure bended, or the fleeing dastard's spear\n   Oft lulleth the mirth of the mighty.  Now me thou dost not fear,\n   Yet fear with me, beloved, for the mighty Maid I fear;\n   And Doom is her name, and full often she maketh me afraid\n   And even now meseemeth on my life her hand is laid.\"\n\nBut he laughed and said:\n\n   \"In what land is she abiding?  Is she near or far away?\n   Will she draw up close beside me in the press of the battle play?\n   And if then I may not smite her 'midst the warriors of the field\n   With the pale blade of my fathers, will she bide the shove of my\n   shield?\"\n\nBut sadly she sang in answer:\n\n   \"In many a stead Doom dwelleth, nor sleepeth day nor night:\n   The rim of the bowl she kisseth, and beareth the chambering light\n   When the kings of men wend happy to the bride-bed from the board.\n   It is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword,\n   When about the house half builded she hangeth many a day;\n   The ship from the strand she shoveth, and on his wonted way\n   By the mountain-hunter fareth where his foot ne'er failed before:\n   She is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river's shore:\n   The mower's scythe she whetteth; and lulleth the shepherd to sleep\n   Where the deadly ling-worm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep.\n   Now we that come of the God-kin of her redes for ourselves we wot,\n   But her will with the lives of men-folk and their ending know we not.\n   So therefore I bid thee not fear for thyself of Doom and her deed,\n   But for me: and I bid thee hearken to the helping of my need.\n   Or else--Art thou happy in life, or lusteth thou to die\n   In the flower of thy days, when thy glory and thy longing bloom on\n   high?\"\n\nBut Thiodolf answered her:\n\n   \"I have deemed, and long have I deemed that this is my second life,\n   That my first one waned with my wounding when thou cam'st to the ring\n   of strife.\n   For when in thine arms I wakened on the hazelled field of yore,\n   Meseemed I had newly arisen to a world I knew no more,\n   So much had all things brightened on that dewy dawn of day.\n   It was dark dull death that I looked for when my thought had died\n   away.\n   It was lovely life that I woke to; and from that day henceforth\n   My joy of the life of man-folk was manifolded of worth.\n   Far fairer the fields of the morning than I had known them erst,\n   And the acres where I wended, and the corn with its half-slaked\n   thirst;\n   And the noble Roof of the Wolfings, and the hawks that sat thereon;\n   And the bodies of my kindred whose deliverance I had won;\n   And the glimmering of the Hall-Sun in the dusky house of old;\n   And my name in the mouth of the maidens, and the praises of the bold,\n   As I sat in my battle-raiment, and the ruddy spear well steeled\n   Leaned 'gainst my side war-battered, and the wounds thine hand had\n   healed.\n   Yea, from that morn thenceforward has my life been good indeed,\n   The gain of to-day was goodly, and good to-morrow's need,\n   And good the whirl of the battle, and the broil I wielded there,\n   Till I fashioned the ordered onset, and the unhoped victory fair.\n   And good were the days thereafter of utter deedless rest\n   And the prattle of thy daughter, and her hands on my unmailed breast.\n   Ah good is the life thou hast given, the life that mine hands have\n   won.\n   And where shall be the ending till the world is all undone?\n   Here sit we twain together, and both we in Godhead clad,\n   We twain of the Wolfing kindred, and each of the other glad.\"\n\nBut she answered, and her face grew darker withal:\n\n   \"O mighty man and joyous, art thou of the Wolfing kin?\n   'Twas no evil deed when we mingled, nor lieth doom therein.\n   Thou lovely man, thou black-haired, thou shalt die and have done no\n   ill.\n   Fame-crowned are the deeds of thy doing, and the mouths of men they\n   fill.\n   Thou betterer of the Godfolk, enduring is thy fame:\n   Yet as a painted image of a dream is thy dreaded name.\n   Of an alien folk thou comest, that we twain might be one indeed.\n   Thou shalt die one day.  So hearken, to help me at my need.\"\n\nHis face grew troubled and he said: \"What is this word that I am no chief\nof the Wolfings?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, \"but better than they.  Look thou on the face of our\ndaughter the Hall-Sun, thy daughter and mine: favoureth she at all of\nme?\"\n\nHe laughed: \"Yea, whereas she is fair, but not otherwise.  This is a hard\nsaying, that I dwell among an alien kindred, and it wotteth not thereof.\nWhy hast thou not told me hereof before?\"\n\nShe said: \"It needed not to tell thee because thy day was waxing, as now\nit waneth.  Once more I bid thee hearken and do my bidding though it be\nhard to thee.\"\n\nHe answered: \"Even so will I as much as I may; and thus wise must thou\nlook upon it, that I love life, and fear not death.\"\n\nThen she spake, and again her words fell into rhyme:\n\n   \"In forty fights hast thou foughten, and been worsted but in four;\n   And I looked on and was merry; and ever more and more\n   Wert thou dear to the heart of the Wood-Sun, and the Chooser of the\n   Slain.\n   But now whereas ye are wending with slaughter-herd and wain\n   To meet a folk that ye know not, a wonder, a peerless foe,\n   I fear for thy glory's waning, and I see thee lying alow.\"\n\nThen he brake in: \"Herein is little shame to be worsted by the might of\nthe mightiest: if this so mighty folk sheareth a limb off the tree of my\nfame, yet shall it wax again.\"\n\nBut she sang:\n\n   \"In forty fights hast thou foughten, and beside thee who but I\n   Beheld the wind-tossed banners, and saw the aspen fly?\n   But to-day to thy war I wend not, for Weird withholdeth me\n   And sore my heart forebodeth for the battle that shall be.\n   To-day with thee I wend not; so I feared, and lo my feet,\n   That are wont to the woodland girdle of the acres of the wheat,\n   For thee among strange people and the foeman's throng have trod,\n   And I tell thee their banner of battle is a wise and a mighty God.\n   For these are the folk of the cities, and in wondrous wise they dwell\n   'Mid confusion of heaped houses, dim and black as the face of hell;\n   Though therefrom rise roofs most goodly, where their captains and\n   their kings\n   Dwell amidst the walls of marble in abundance of fair things;\n   And 'mid these, nor worser nor better, but builded otherwise\n   Stand the Houses of the Fathers, and the hidden mysteries.\n   And as close as are the tree-trunks that within the beech-wood thrive\n   E'en so many are their pillars; and therein like men alive\n   Stand the images of god-folk in such raiment as they wore\n   In the years before the cities and the hidden days of yore.\n   Ah for the gold that I gazed on! and their store of battle gear,\n   And strange engines that I knew not, or the end for which they were.\n   Ah for the ordered wisdom of the war-array of these,\n   And the folks that are sitting about them in dumb down-trodden peace!\n   So I thought now fareth war-ward my well-beloved friend,\n   And the weird of the Gods hath doomed it that no more with him may I\n   wend!\n   Woe's me for the war of the Wolfings wherefrom I am sundered apart,\n   And the fruitless death of the war-wise, and the doom of the hardy\n   heart!\"\n\nThen he answered, and his eyes grew kind as he looked on her:\n\n   \"For thy fair love I thank thee, and thy faithful word, O friend!\n   But how might it otherwise happen but we twain must meet in the end,\n   The God of this mighty people and the Markmen and their kin?\n   Lo, this is the weird of the world, and what may we do herein?\"\n\nThen mirth came into her face again as she said:\n\n\"Who wotteth of Weird, and what she is till the weird is accomplished?\nLong hath it been my weird to love thee and to fashion deeds for thee as\nI may; nor will I depart from it now.\"  And she sang:\n\n   \"Keen-edged is the sword of the city, and bitter is its spear,\n   But thy breast in the battle, beloved, hath a wall of the stithy's\n   gear.\n   What now is thy wont in the handplay with the helm and the hauberk of\n   rings?\n   Farest thou as the thrall and the cot-carle, or clad in the raiment of\n   kings?\"\n\nHe started, and his face reddened as he answered:\n\n   \"O Wood-Sun thou wottest our battle and the way wherein we fare:\n   That oft at the battle's beginning the helm and the hauberk we bear;\n   Lest the shaft of the fleeing coward or the bow at adventure bent\n   Should slay us ere the need be, ere our might be given and spent.\n   Yet oft ere the fight is over, and Doom hath scattered the foe,\n   No leader of the people by his war-gear shall ye know,\n   But by his hurts the rather, from the cot-carle and the thrall:\n   For when all is done that a man may, 'tis the hour for a man to fall.\"\n\nShe yet smiled as she said in answer:\n\n   \"O Folk-wolf, heed and hearken; for when shall thy life be spent\n   And the Folk wherein thou dwellest with thy death be well content?\n   Whenso folk need the fire, do they hew the apple-tree,\n   And burn the Mother of Blossom and the fruit that is to be?\n   Or me wilt thou bid to thy grave-mound because thy battle-wrath\n   May nothing more be bridled than the whirl wind on his path?\n   So hearken and do my bidding, for the hauberk shalt thou bear\n   E'en when the other warriors cast off their battle-gear.\n   So come thou, come unwounded from the war-field of the south,\n   And sit with me in the beech-wood, and kiss me, eyes and mouth.\"\n\nAnd she kissed him in very deed, and made much of him, and fawned on him,\nand laid her hand on his breast, and he was soft and blithe with her, but\nat last he laughed and said:\n\n   \"God's Daughter, long hast thou lived, and many a matter seen,\n   And men full often grieving for the deed that might have been;\n   But here my heart thou wheedlest as a maid of tender years\n   When first in the arms of her darling the horn of war she hears.\n   Thou knowest the axe to be heavy, and the sword, how keen it is;\n   But that Doom of which thou hast spoken, wilt thou not tell of this,\n   God's Daughter, how it sheareth, and how it breaketh through\n   Each wall that the warrior buildeth, yea all deeds that he may do?\n   What might in the hammer's leavings, in the fire's thrall shall abide\n   To turn that Folks' o'erwhelmer from the fated warrior's side?\"\n\nThen she laughed in her turn, and loudly; but so sweetly that the sound\nof her voice mingled with the first song of a newly awakened wood-thrush\nsitting on a rowan twig on the edge of the Wood-lawn.  But she said:\n\n   \"Yea, I that am God's Daughter may tell thee never a whit\n   From what land cometh the hauberk nor what smith smithied it,\n   That thou shalt wear in the handplay from the first stroke to the\n   last;\n   But this thereof I tell thee, that it holdeth firm and fast\n   The life of the body it lappeth, if the gift of the Godfolk it be.\n   Lo this is the yoke-mate of doom, and the gift of me unto thee.\"\n\nThen she leaned down from the stone whereon they sat, and her hand was in\nthe dewy grass for a little, and then it lifted up a dark grey rippling\ncoat of rings; and she straightened herself in the seat again, and laid\nthat hauberk on the knees of Thiodolf, and he put his hand to it, and\nturned it about, while he pondered long: then at last he said:\n\n   \"What evil thing abideth with this warder of the strife,\n   This burg and treasure chamber for the hoarding of my life?\n   For this is the work of the dwarfs, and no kindly kin of the earth;\n   And all we fear the dwarf-kin and their anger and sorrow and mirth.\"\n\nShe cast her arms about him and fondled him, and her voice grew sweeter\nthan the voice of any mortal thing as she answered:\n\n   \"No ill for thee, beloved, or for me in the hauberk lies;\n   No sundering grief is in it, no lonely miseries.\n   But we shall abide together, and that new life I gave,\n   For a long while yet henceforward we twain its joy shall have.\n   Yea, if thou dost my bidding to wear my gift in the fight\n   No hunter of the wild-wood at the changing of the night\n   Shall see my shape on thy grave-mound or my tears in the morning find\n   With the dew of the morning mingled; nor with the evening wind\n   Shall my body pass the shepherd as he wandereth in the mead\n   And fill him with forebodings on the eve of the Wolfings' need.\n   Nor the horse-herd wake in the midnight and hear my fateful cry;\n   Nor yet shall the Wolfing women hear words on the wind go by\n   As they weave and spin the night down when the House is gone to the\n   war,\n   And weep for the swains they wedded and the children that they bore.\n   Yea do my bidding, O Folk-wolf, lest a grief of the Gods should weigh\n   On the ancient House of the Wolfings and my death o'ercloud its day.\"\n\nAnd still she clung about him, while he spake no word of yea or nay: but\nat the last he let himself glide wholly into her arms, and the\ndwarf-wrought hauberk fell from his knees and lay on the grass.\n\nSo they abode together in that wood-lawn till the twilight was long gone,\nand the sun arisen for some while.  And when Thiodolf stepped out of the\nbeech-wood into the broad sunshine dappled with the shadow of the leaves\nof the hazels moving gently in the fresh morning air, he was covered from\nthe neck to the knee by a hauberk of rings dark and grey and gleaming,\nfashioned by the dwarfs of ancient days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE HOUSE FARETH TO THE WAR\n\n\nNow when Thiodolf came back to the habitations of the kindred the whole\nHouse was astir, both thrall-men and women, and free women hurrying from\ncot to stithy, and from stithy to hall bearing the last of the war-gear\nor raiment for the fighting-men.  But they for their part were some\nstanding about anigh the Man's-door, some sitting gravely within the\nhall, some watching the hurry of the thralls and women from the midmost\nof the open space amidst of the habitations, whereon there stood yet\ncertain wains which were belated: for the most of the wains were now\nstanding with the oxen already yoked to them down in the meadow past the\nacres, encircled by a confused throng of kine and horses and thrall-folk,\nfor thither had all the beasts for the slaughter, and the horses for the\nwarriors been brought; and there were the horses tethered or held by the\nthralls; some indeed were already saddled and bridled, and on others were\nthe thralls doing the harness.\n\nBut as for the wains of the Markmen, they were stoutly framed of ash-tree\nwith panels of aspen, and they were broad-wheeled so that they might go\nover rough and smooth.  They had high tilts over them well framed of\nwillow-poles covered over with squares of black felt over-lapping like\nshingles; which felt they made of the rough of their fleeces, for they\nhad many sheep.  And these wains were to them for houses upon the way if\nneed were, and therein as now were stored their meal and their war-store\nand after fight they would flit their wounded men in them, such as were\ntoo sorely hurt to back a horse: nor must it be hidden that whiles they\nlooked to bring back with them the treasure of the south.  Moreover the\nfolk if they were worsted in any battle, instead of fleeing without more\ndone, would often draw back fighting into a garth made by these wains,\nand guarded by some of their thralls; and there would abide the onset of\nthose who had thrust them back in the field.  And this garth they called\nthe Wain-burg.\n\nSo now stood three of these wains aforesaid belated amidst of the\nhabitations of the House, their yoke-beasts standing or lying down\nunharnessed as yet to them: but in the very midst of that place was a\nwain unlike to them; smaller than they but higher; square of shape as to\nthe floor of it; built lighter than they, yet far stronger; as the\nwarrior is stronger than the big carle and trencher-licker that loiters\nabout the hall; and from the midst of this wain arose a mast made of a\ntall straight fir-tree, and thereon hung the banner of the Wolfings,\nwherein was wrought the image of the Wolf, but red of hue as a token of\nwar, and with his mouth open and gaping upon the foemen.  Also whereas\nthe other wains were drawn by mere oxen, and those of divers colours, as\nchance would have it, the wain of the banner was drawn by ten black bulls\nof the mightiest of the herd, deep-dewlapped, high-crested and\ncurly-browed; and their harness was decked with gold, and so was the wain\nitself, and the woodwork of it painted red with vermilion.  There then\nstood the Banner of the House of the Wolfings awaiting the departure of\nthe warriors to the hosting.\n\nSo Thiodolf stood on the top of the bent beside that same mound wherefrom\nhe had blown the War-horn yester-eve, and which was called the Hill of\nSpeech, and he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked around him; and\neven therewith the carles fell to yoking the beasts to the belated wains,\nand the warriors gathered together from out of the mixed throngs, and\ncame from the Roof and the Man's-door and all set their faces toward the\nHill of Speech.\n\nSo Thiodolf knew that all was ready for departure, and it wanted but an\nhour of high-noon; so he turned about and went into the Hall, and there\nfound his shield and his spear hanging in his sleeping place beside the\nhauberk he was wont to wear; then he looked, as one striving with\nthought, at his empty hauberk and his own body covered with the dwarf-\nwrought rings; nor did his face change as he took his shield and his\nspear and turned away.  Then he went to the dais and there sat his foster-\ndaughter (as men deemed her) sitting amidst of it as yester-eve, and now\narrayed in a garment of fine white wool, on the breast whereof were\nwrought in gold two beasts ramping up against a fire-altar whereon a\nflame flickered; and on the skirts and the hems were other devices, of\nwolves chasing deer, and men shooting with the bow; and that garment was\nan ancient treasure; but she had a broad girdle of gold and gems about\nher middle, and on her arms and neck she wore great gold rings wrought\ndelicately.  By then there were few save the Hall-Sun under the Roof, and\nthey but the oldest of the women, or a few very old men, and some who\nwere ailing and might not go abroad.  But before her on the thwart table\nlay the Great War-horn awaiting the coming of Thiodolf to give signal of\ndeparture.\n\nThen went Thiodolf to the Hall-Sun and kissed and embraced her fondly,\nand she gave the horn into his hands, and he went forth and up on to the\nHill of Speech, and blew thence a short blast on the horn, and then came\nall the Warriors flocking to the Hill of Speech, each man stark in his\nharness, alert and joyous.\n\nThen presently through the Man's-door came the Hall-Sun in that ancient\ngarment, which fell straight and stiff down to her ancles as she stepped\nlightly and slowly along, her head crowned with a garland of eglantine.\nIn her right hand also she held a great torch of wax lighted, whose flame\namidst the bright sunlight looked like a wavering leaf of vermilion.\n\nThe warriors saw her, and made a lane for her, and she made her way\nthrough it up to the Hill of Speech, and she went up to the top of it and\nstood there holding the lighted candle in her hand, so that all might see\nit.  Then suddenly was there as great a silence as there may be on a\nforenoon of summer; for even the thralls down in the meadow had noted\nwhat was toward, and ceased their talking and shouting, for as far off as\nthey were, since they could see that the Hall-Sun stood on the Hill of\nSpeech, for the wood was dark behind her; so they knew the Farewell Flame\nwas lighted, and that the maiden would speak; and to all men her speech\nwas a boding of good or of ill.\n\nSo she began in a sweet voice yet clear and far-reaching:\n\n   \"O Warriors of the Wolfings by the token of the flame\n   That here in my right hand flickers, come aback to the House of the\n   Name!\n   For there yet burneth the Hall-Sun beneath the Wolfing roof,\n   And this flame is litten from it, nor as now shall it fare aloof\n   Till again it seeth the mighty and the men to be gleaned from the\n   fight.\n   So wend ye as weird willeth and let your hearts be light;\n   For through your days of battle all the deeds of our days shall be\n   fair.\n   To-morrow beginneth the haysel, as if every carle were here;\n   And who knoweth ere your returning but the hook shall smite the corn?\n   But the kine shall go down to the meadow as their wont is every morn,\n   And each eve shall come back to the byre; and the mares and foals\n   afield\n   Shall ever be heeded duly; and all things shall their increase yield.\n   And if it shall befal us that hither cometh a foe\n   Here have we swains of the shepherds good players with the bow,\n   And old men battle-crafty whose might is nowise spent,\n   And women fell and fearless well wont to tread the bent\n   Amid the sheep and the oxen; and their hands are hard with the spear\n   And their arms are strong and stalwart the battle shield to bear;\n   And store of weapons have we and the mighty walls of the stead;\n   And the Roof shall abide you steadfast with the Hall-Sun overhead.\n   Lo here I quench this candle that is lit from the Hall-Sun's flame\n   Which unto the Wild-wood clearing with the kin of the Wolfings came\n   And shall wend with their departure to the limits of the earth;\n   Nor again shall the torch be lighted till in sorrow or in mirth,\n   Overthrown or overthrowing, ye come aback once more,\n   And bid me bear the candle before the Wolf of War.\"\n\nAs she spake the word she turned the candle downward, and thrust it\nagainst the grass and quenched it indeed; but the whole throng of\nwarriors turned about, for the bulls of the banner-wain lowered their\nheads in the yokes and began to draw, lowing mightily; and the wain\ncreaked and moved on, and all the men-at-arms followed after, and down\nthey went through the lanes of the corn, and a many women and children\nand old men went down into the mead with them.\n\nIn their hearts they all wondered what the Hall-Sun's words might\nsignify; for she had told them nought about the battles to be, saving\nthat some should come back to the Mid-mark; whereas aforetime somewhat\nwould she foretell to them concerning the fortune of the fight, and now\nhad she said to them nothing but what their own hearts told them.\nNevertheless they bore their crests high as they followed the Wolf down\ninto the meadow, where all was now ready for departure.  There they\narrayed themselves and went down to the lip of Mirkwood-water; and such\nwas their array that the banner went first, save that a band of fully\narmed men went before it; and behind it and about were the others as well\narrayed as they.  Then went the wains that bore their munition, with\narmed carles of the thrall-folk about them, who were ever the guard of\nthe wains, and should never leave them night or day; and lastly went the\ngreat band of the warriors and the rest of the thralls with them.\n\nAs to their war-gear, all the freemen had helms of some kind, but not all\nof iron or steel; for some bore helms fashioned of horse-hide and bull-\nhide covered over with the similitude of a Wolf's muzzle; nor were these\nill-defence against a sword-stroke.  Shields they all had, and all these\nhad the image of the Wolf marked on them, but for many their thralls bore\nthem on the journey.  As to their body-armour some carried long byrnies\nof ring-mail, some coats of leather covered with splinters of horn laid\nlike the shingles of a roof, and some skin-coats only: whereof indeed\nthere were some of which tales went that they were better than the\nsmith's hammer-work, because they had had spells sung over them to keep\nout steel or iron.\n\nBut for their weapons, they bore spears with shafts not very long, some\neight feet of our measure; and axes heavy and long-shafted; and bills\nwith great and broad heads; and some few, but not many of the kindred\nwere bowmen, and every freeman was girt with a sword; but of the swords\nsome were long and two-edged, some short and heavy, cutting on one edge,\nand these were of the kind which they and our forefathers long after\ncalled 'sax.'  Thus were the freemen arrayed.\n\nBut for the thralls, there were many bows among them, especially among\nthose who were of blood alien from the Goths; the others bore short\nspears, and feathered broad arrows, and clubs bound with iron, and knives\nand axes, but not every man of them had a sword.  Few iron helms they had\nand no ringed byrnies, but most had a buckler at their backs with no sign\nor symbol on it.\n\nThus then set forth the fighting men of the House of the Wolf toward the\nThing-stead of the Upper-mark where the hosting was to be, and by then\nthey were moving up along the side of Mirkwood-water it was somewhat past\nhigh-noon.\n\nBut the stay-at-home people who had come down with them to the meadow\nlingered long in that place; and much foreboding there was among them of\nevil to come; and of the old folk, some remembered tales of the past days\nof the Markmen, and how they had come from the ends of the earth, and the\nmountains where none dwell now but the Gods of their kindreds; and many\nof these tales told of their woes and their wars as they went from river\nto river and from wild-wood to wild-wood before they had established\ntheir Houses in the Mark, and fallen to dwelling there season by season\nand year by year whether the days were good or ill.  And it fell into\ntheir hearts that now at last mayhappen was their abiding wearing out to\nan end, and that the day should soon be when they should have to bear the\nHall-Sun through the wild-wood, and seek a new dwelling-place afar from\nthe troubling of these newly arisen Welsh foemen.\n\nAnd so those of them who could not rid themselves of this foreboding were\nsomewhat heavier of heart than their wont was when the House went to the\nWar.  For long had they abided there in the Mark, and the life was sweet\nto them which they knew, and the life which they knew not was bitter to\nthem: and Mirkwood-water was become as a God to them no less than to\ntheir fathers of old time; nor lesser was the mead where fed the horses\nthat they loved and the kine that they had reared, and the sheep that\nthey guarded from the Wolf of the Wild-wood: and they worshipped the kind\nacres which they themselves and their fathers had made fruitful, wedding\nthem to the seasons of seed-time and harvest, that the birth that came\nfrom them might become a part of the kindred of the Wolf, and the joy and\nmight of past springs and summers might run in the blood of the Wolfing\nchildren.  And a dear God indeed to them was the Roof of the Kindred,\nthat their fathers had built and that they yet warded against the fire\nand the lightening and the wind and the snow, and the passing of the days\nthat devour and the years that heap the dust over the work of men.  They\nthought of how it had stood, and seen so many generations of men come and\ngo; how often it had welcomed the new-born babe, and given farewell to\nthe old man: how many secrets of the past it knew; how many tales which\nmen of the present had forgotten, but which yet mayhap men of times to\ncome should learn of it; for to them yet living it had spoken time and\nagain, and had told them what their fathers had not told them, and it\nheld the memories of the generations and the very life of the Wolfings\nand their hopes for the days to be.\n\nThus these poor people thought of the Gods whom they worshipped, and the\nfriends whom they loved, and could not choose but be heavy-hearted when\nthey thought that the wild-wood was awaiting them to swallow all up, and\ntake away from them their Gods and their friends and the mirth of their\nlife, and burden them with hunger and thirst and weariness, that their\nchildren might begin once more to build the House and establish the\ndwelling, and call new places by old names, and worship new Gods with the\nancient worship.\n\nSuch imaginations of trouble then were in the hearts of the stay-at-homes\nof the Wolfings; the tale tells not indeed that all had such forebodings,\nbut chiefly the old folk who were nursing the end of their life-days\namidst the cherishing Kindred of the House.\n\nBut now they were beginning to turn them back again to the habitations,\nand a thin stream was flowing through the acres, when they heard a\nconfused sound drawing near blended of horns and the lowing of beasts and\nthe shouting of men; and they looked and saw a throng of brightly clad\nmen coming up stream alongside of Mirkwood-water; and they were not\nafraid, for they knew that it must be some other company of the Markmen\njourneying to the hosting of the Folk: and presently they saw that it was\nthe House of the Beamings following their banner on the way to the Thing-\nstead.  But when the new-comers saw the throng out in the meads, some of\ntheir young men pricked on their horses and galloped on past the women\nand old men, to whom they threw a greeting, as they ran past to catch up\nwith the bands of the Wolfings; for between the two houses was there\naffinity, and much good liking lay between them; and the stay-at-homes,\nmany of them, lingered yet till the main body of the Beamings came with\ntheir banner: and their array was much like to that of the Wolfings, but\ngayer; for whereas it pleased the latter to darken all their war-gear to\nthe colour of the grey Wolf, the Beamings polished all their gear as\nbright as might be, and their raiment also was mostly bright green of hue\nand much beflowered; and the sign on their banner was a green leafy tree,\nand the wain was drawn by great white bulls.\n\nSo when their company drew anear to the throng of the stay-at-homes they\nwent to meet and greet each other, and tell tidings to each other; but\ntheir banner held steadily onward amidst their converse, and in a little\nwhile they followed it, for the way was long to the Thing-stead of the\nUpper-mark.\n\nSo passed away the fighting men by the side of Mirkwood-water, and the\nthrong of the stay-at-homes melted slowly from the meadow and trickled\nalong through the acres to the habitations of the Wolfings, and there\nthey fell to doing whatso of work or play came to their hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--CONCERNING THE HALL-SUN\n\n\nWhen the warriors and the others had gone down to the mead, the Hall-Sun\nwas left standing on the Hill of Speech, and she stood there till she saw\nthe host in due array going on its ways dark and bright and beautiful;\nthen she made as if to turn aback to the Great Roof; but all at once it\nseemed to her as if something held her back, as if her will to move had\ndeparted from her, and that she could not put one foot before the other.\nSo she lingered on the Hill, and the quenched candle fell from her hand,\nand presently she sank adown on the grass and sat there with the face of\none thinking intently.  Yet was it with her that a thousand thoughts were\nin her mind at once and no one of them uppermost, and images of what had\nbeen and what then was flickered about in her brain, and betwixt them\nwere engendered images of things to be, but unstable and not to be trowed\nin.  So sat the Hall-Sun on the Hill of Speech lost in a dream of the\nday, whose stories were as little clear as those of a night-dream.\n\nBut as she sat musing thus, came to her a woman exceeding old to look on,\nwhom she knew not as one of the kindred or a thrall; and this carline\ngreeted her by the name of Hall-Sun and said:\n\n   \"Hail, Hall-Sun of the Markmen! how fares it now with thee\n   When the whelps of the Woodbeast wander with the Leafage of the Tree\n   All up the Mirkwood-water to seek what they shall find,\n   The oak-boles of the battle and the war-wood stark and blind?\"\n\nThen answered the maiden:\n\n   \"It fares with me, O mother, that my soul would fain go forth\n   To behold the ways of the battle, and the praise of the warriors'\n   worth.\n   But yet is it held entangled in a maze of many a thing,\n   As the low-grown bramble holdeth the brake-shoots of the Spring.\n   I think of the thing that hath been, but no shape is in my thought;\n   I think of the day that passeth, and its story comes to nought.\n   I think of the days that shall be, nor shape I any tale.\n   I will hearken thee, O mother, if hearkening may avail.\"\n\nThe Carline gazed at her with dark eyes that shone brightly from amidst\nher brown wrinkled face: then she sat herself down beside her and spake:\n\n   \"From a far folk have I wandered and I come of an alien blood,\n   But I know all tales of the Wolfings and their evil and their good;\n   And when I heard of thy fairness, thereof I heard it said,\n   That for thee should be never a bridal nor a place in the warrior's\n   bed.\"\n\nThe maiden neither reddened nor paled, but looking with calm steady eyes\ninto the Carline's face she answered:\n\n   \"Yea true it is, I am wedded to the mighty ones of old,\n   And the fathers of the Wolfings ere the days of field and fold.\"\n\nThen a smile came into the eyes of the old woman and she said.\n\n   \"How glad shall be thy mother of thy worship and thy worth,\n   And the father that begat thee if yet they dwell on earth!\"\n\nBut the Hall-Sun answered in the same steady manner as before:\n\n   \"None knoweth who is my mother, nor my very father's name;\n   But when to the House of the Wolfings a wild-wood waif I came,\n   They gave me a foster-mother an ancient dame and good,\n   And a glorious foster-father the best of all the blood.\"\n\nSpake the Carline.\n\n   \"Yea, I have heard the story, but scarce therein might I trow\n   That thou with all thy beauty wert born 'neath the oaken bough,\n   And hast crawled a naked baby o'er the rain-drenched autumn-grass;\n   Wilt thou tell the wandering woman what wise it cometh to pass\n   That thou art the Mid-mark's Hall-Sun, and the sign of the Wolfings'\n   gain?\n   Thou shalt pleasure me much by the telling, and there of shalt thou be\n   fain.\"\n\nThen answered the Hall-Sun.\n\n   \"Yea; thus much I remember for the first of my memories;\n   That I lay on the grass in the morning and above were the boughs of\n   the trees.\n   But nought naked was I as the wood-whelp, but clad in linen white,\n   And adown the glades of the oakwood the morning sun lay bright.\n   Then a hind came out of the thicket and stood on the sunlit glade,\n   And turned her head toward the oak tree and a step on toward me made.\n   Then stopped, and bounded aback, and away as if in fear,\n   That I saw her no more; then I wondered, though sitting close anear\n   Was a she-wolf great and grisly.  But with her was I wont to play,\n   And pull her ears, and belabour her rugged sides and grey,\n   And hold her jaws together, while she whimpered, slobbering\n   For the love of my love; and nowise I deemed her a fearsome thing.\n   There she sat as though she were watching, and o'er head a blue-winged\n   jay\n   Shrieked out from the topmost oak-twigs, and a squirrel ran his way\n   Two tree-trunks off.  But the she-wolf arose up suddenly\n   And growled with her neck-fell bristling, as if danger drew anigh;\n   And therewith I heard a footstep, for nice was my ear to catch\n   All the noises of the wild-wood; so there did we sit at watch\n   While the sound of feet grew nigher: then I clapped hand on hand\n   And crowed for joy and gladness, for there out in the sun did stand\n   A man, a glorious creature with a gleaming helm on his head,\n   And gold rings on his arms, in raiment gold-broidered crimson-red.\n   Straightway he strode up toward us nor heeded the wolf of the wood\n   But sang as he went in the oak-glade, as a man whose thought is good,\n   And nought she heeded the warrior, but tame as a sheep was grown,\n   And trotted away through the wild-wood with her crest all laid adown.\n   Then came the man and sat down by the oak-bole close unto me\n   And took me up nought fearful and set me on his knee.\n   And his face was kind and lovely, so my cheek to his cheek I laid\n   And touched his cold bright war-helm and with his gold rings played,\n   And hearkened his words, though I knew not what tale they had to tell,\n   Yet fain was my heart of their music, and meseemed I loved him well.\n   So we fared for a while and were fain, till he set down my feet on the\n   grass,\n   And kissed me and stood up himself, and away through the wood did he\n   pass.\n   And then came back the she-wolf and with her I played and was fain.\n   Lo the first thing I remember: wilt thou have me babble again?\"\n\nSpake the Carline and her face was soft and kind:\n\n   \"Nay damsel, long would I hearken to thy voice this summer day.\n   But how didst thou leave the wild-wood, what people brought thee\n   away?\"\n\nThen said the Hall-Sun:\n\n   \"I awoke on a time in the even, and voices I heard as I woke;\n   And there was I in the wild-wood by the bole of the ancient oak,\n   And a ring of men was around me, and glad was I indeed\n   As I looked upon their faces and the fashion of their weed.\n   For I gazed on the red and the scarlet and the beaten silver and gold,\n   And blithe were their noble faces and kindly to behold,\n   And nought had I seen of such-like since that hour of the other day\n   When that warrior came to the oak glade with the little child to play.\n   And forth now he came, with the face that my hands had fondled before,\n   And a battle shield wrought fairly upon his arm he bore,\n   And thereon the wood-wolf's image in ruddy gold was done.\n   Then I stretched out my little arms towards the glorious shining one\n   And he took me up and set me on his shoulder for a while\n   And turned about to his fellows with a blithe and joyous smile;\n   And they shouted aloud about me and drew forth gleaming swords\n   And clashed them on their bucklers; but nought I knew of the words\n   Of their shouting and rejoicing.  So thereafter was I laid\n   And borne forth on the warrior's warshield, and our way through the\n   wood we made\n   'Midst the mirth and great contentment of those fair-clad shielded\n   men.\n\n   \"But no tale of the wolf and the wild-wood abides with me since then,\n   And the next thing I remember is a huge and dusky hall,\n   A world for my little body from ancient wall to wall;\n   A world of many doings, and nought for me to do,\n   A world of many noises, and known to me were few.\n\n   \"Time wore, and I spoke with the Wolfings and knew the speech of the\n   kin,\n   And was strange 'neath the roof no longer, as a lonely waif therein;\n   And I wrought as a child with my playmates and every hour looked on\n   Unto the next hour's joyance till the happy day was done.\n   And going and coming amidst us was a woman tall and thin\n   With hair like the hoary barley and silver streaks therein.\n   And kind and sad of visage, as now I remember me,\n   And she sat and told us stories when we were aweary with glee,\n   And many of us she fondled, but me the most of all.\n   And once from my sleep she waked me and bore me down the hall,\n   In the hush of the very midnight, and I was feared thereat.\n   But she brought me unto the dais, and there the warrior sat,\n   Who took me up and kissed me, as erst within the wood;\n   And meseems in his arms I slumbered: but I wakened again and stood\n   Alone with the kindly woman, and gone was the goodly man,\n   And athwart the hush of the Folk-hall the moon shone bright and wan,\n   And the woman dealt with a lamp hung up by a chain aloft,\n   And she trimmed it and fed it with oil, while she chanted sweet and\n   soft\n   A song whose words I knew not: then she ran it up again,\n   And up in the darkness above us died the length of its wavering\n   chain.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the carline, \"this woman will have been the Hall-Sun that\ncame before thee.  What next dost thou remember?\"\n\nSaid the maiden:\n\n   \"Next I mind me of the hazels behind the People's Roof,\n   And the children running thither and the magpie flitting aloof,\n   And my hand in the hand of the Hall-Sun, as after the others we went,\n   And she soberly hearkening my prattle and the words of my intent.\n   And now would I call her 'Mother,' and indeed I loved her well.\n\n   \"So I waxed; and now of my memories the tale were long to tell;\n   But as the days passed over, and I fared to field and wood,\n   Alone or with my playmates, still the days were fair and good.\n   But the sad and kindly Hall-Sun for my fosterer now I knew,\n   And the great and glorious warrior that my heart clung sorely to\n   Was but my foster-father; and I knew that I had no kin\n   In the ancient House of the Wolfings, though love was warm therein.\"\n\nThen smiled the carline and said: \"Yea, he is thy foster-father, and yet\na fond one.\"\n\n\"Sooth is that,\" said the Hall-Sun.  \"But wise art thou by seeming.  Hast\nthou come to tell me of what kindred I am, and who is my father and who\nis my mother?\"\n\nSaid the carline: \"Art thou not also wise?  Is it not so that the Hall-\nSun of the Wolfings seeth things that are to come?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"yet have I seen waking or sleeping no other father save\nmy foster-father; yet my very mother I have seen, as one who should meet\nher in the flesh one day.\"\n\n\"And good is that,\" said the carline; and as she spoke her face waxed\nkinder, and she said:\n\n\"Tell us more of thy days in the House of the Wolfings and how thou\nfaredst there.\"\n\nSaid the Hall-Sun:\n\n   \"I waxed 'neath the Roof of the Wolfings, till now to look upon\n   I was of sixteen winters, and the love of the Folk I won,\n   And in lovely weed they clad me like the image of a God:\n   And lonely now full often the wild-wood ways I trod,\n   And I feared no wild-wood creature, and my presence scared them\n   nought;\n   And I fell to know of wisdom, and within me stirred my thought,\n   So that oft anights would I wander through the mead and far away,\n   And swim the Mirkwood-water, and amidst his eddies play\n   When earth was dark in the dawn-tide; and over all the folk\n   I knew of the beasts' desires, as though in words they spoke.\n\n   \"So I saw of things that should be, were they mighty things or small,\n   And upon a day as it happened came the war-word to the hall,\n   And the House must wend to the warfield, and as they sang, and played\n   With the strings of the harp that even, and the mirth of the war-eve\n   made,\n   Came the sight of the field to my eyes, and the words waxed hot in me,\n   And I needs must show the picture of the end of the fight to be.\n   Then I showed them the Red Wolf bristling o'er the broken fleeing foe;\n   And the war-gear of the fleers, and their banner did I show,\n   To wit the Ling-worm's image with the maiden in his mouth;\n   There I saw my foster-father 'mid the pale blades of the South,\n   Till aloof swept all the handplay and the hurry of the chase,\n   And he lay along by an ash-tree, no helm about his face,\n   No byrny on his body; and an arrow in his thigh,\n   And a broken spear in his shoulder.  Then I saw myself draw nigh\n   To sing the song blood-staying.  Then saw I how we twain\n   Went 'midst of the host triumphant in the Wolfings' banner-wain,\n   The black bulls lowing before us athwart the warriors' song,\n   As up from Mirkwood-water we went our ways along\n   To the Great Roof of the Wolfings, whence streamed the women out\n   And the sound of their rejoicing blent with the warriors' shout.\n\n   \"They heard me and saw the picture, and they wotted how wise I was\n   grown,\n   And they loved me, and glad were their hearts at the tale my lips had\n   shown;\n   And my body clad as an image of a God to the field they bore,\n   And I held by the mast of the banner as I looked upon their war,\n   And endured to see unblenching on the wind-swept sunny plain\n   All the picture of my vision by the men-folk done again.\n   And over my Foster-father I sang the staunching-song,\n   Till the life-blood that was ebbing flowed back to his heart the\n   strong,\n   And we wended back in the war-wain 'midst the gleanings of the fight\n   Unto the ancient dwelling and the Hall-Sun's glimmering light.\n\n   \"So from that day henceforward folk hung upon my words,\n   For the battle of the autumn, and the harvest of the swords;\n   And e'en more was I loved than aforetime.  So wore a year away,\n   And heavy was the burden of the lore that on me lay.\n\n   \"But my fosterer the Hall-Sun took sick at the birth of the year,\n   And changed her life as the year changed, as summer drew anear.\n   But she knew that her life was waning, and lying in her bed\n   She taught me the lore of the Hall-Sun, and every word to be said\n   At the trimming in the midnight and the feeding in the morn,\n   And she laid her hands upon me ere unto the howe she was borne\n   With the kindred gathered about us; and they wotted her weird and her\n   will,\n   And hailed me for the Hall-Sun when at last she lay there still.\n   And they did on me the garment, the holy cloth of old,\n   And the neck-chain wrought for the goddess, and the rings of the\n   hallowed gold.\n   So here am I abiding, and of things to be I tell,\n   Yet know not what shall befall me nor why with the Wolfings I dwell.\"\n\nThen said the carline:\n\n   \"What seest thou, O daughter, of the journey of to-day?\n   And why wendest thou not with the war-host on the battle-echoing way?\"\n\nSaid the Hall-Sun.\n\n   \"O mother, here dwelleth the Hall-Sun while the kin hath a dwelling-\n   place,\n   Nor ever again shall I look on the onset or the chase,\n   Till the day when the Roof of the Wolfings looketh down on the girdle\n   of foes,\n   And the arrow singeth over the grass of the kindred's close;\n   Till the pillars shake with the shouting and quivers the roof-tree\n   dear,\n   When the Hall of the Wolfings garners the harvest of the spear.\"\n\nTherewith she stood on her feet and turned her face to the Great Roof,\nand gazed long at it, not heeding the crone by her side; and she muttered\nwords of whose signification the other knew not, though she listened\nintently, and gazed ever at her as closely as might be.\n\nThen fell the Hall-Sun utterly silent, and the lids closed over her eyes,\nand her hands were clenched, and her feet pressed hard on the daisies:\nher bosom heaved with sore sighs, and great tear-drops oozed from under\nher eyelids and fell on to her raiment and her feet and on to the flowery\nsummer grass; and at the last her mouth opened and she spake, but in a\nvoice that was marvellously changed from that she spake in before:\n\n   \"Why went ye forth, O Wolfings, from the garth your fathers built,\n   And the House where sorrow dieth, and all unloosed is guilt?\n   Turn back, turn back, and behold it! lest your feet be over slow\n   When your shields are heavy-burdened with the arrows of the foe;\n   How ye totter, how ye stumble on the rough and corpse-strewn way!\n   And lo, how the eve is eating the afternoon of day!\n   O why are ye abiding till the sun is sunk in night\n   And the forest trees are ruddy with the battle-kindled light?\n   O rest not yet, ye Wolfings, lest void be your resting-place,\n   And into lands that ye know not the Wolf must turn his face,\n   And ye wander and ye wander till the land in the ocean cease,\n   And your battle bring no safety and your labour no increase.\"\n\nThen was she silent for a while, and her tears ceased to flow; but\npresently her eyes opened once more, and she lifted up her voice and\ncried aloud--\n\n   \"I see, I see!  O Godfolk behold it from aloof,\n   How the little flames steal flickering along the ridge of the Roof!\n   They are small and red 'gainst the heavens in the summer afternoon;\n   But when the day is dusking, white, high shall they wave to the moon.\n   Lo, the fire plays now on the windows like strips of scarlet cloth\n   Wind-waved! but look in the night-tide on the onset of its wrath,\n   How it wraps round the ancient timbers and hides the mighty roof\n   But lighteth little crannies, so lost and far aloof,\n   That no man yet of the kindred hath seen them ere to-night,\n   Since first the builder builded in loving and delight!\"\n\nThen again she stayed her speech with weeping and sobbing, but after a\nwhile was still again, and then she spoke pointing toward the roof with\nher right hand.\n\n   \"I see the fire-raisers and iron-helmed they are,\n   Brown-faced about the banners that their hands have borne afar.\n   And who in the garth of the kindred shall bear adown their shield\n   Since the onrush of the Wolfings they caught in the open field,\n   As the might of the mountain lion falls dead in the hempen net?\n   O Wolfings, long have ye tarried, but the hour abideth yet.\n   What life for the life of the people shall be given once for all,\n   What sorrow shall stay sorrow in the half-burnt Wolfing Hall?\n   There is nought shall quench the fire save the tears of the Godfolk's\n   kin,\n   And the heart of the life-delighter, and the life-blood cast therein.\"\n\nThen once again she fell silent, and her eyes closed again, and the slow\ntears gushed out from them, and she sank down sobbing on the grass, and\nlittle by little the storm of grief sank and her head fell back, and she\nwas as one quietly asleep.  Then the carline hung over her and kissed her\nand embraced her; and then through her closed eyes and her slumber did\nthe Hall-Sun see a marvel; for she who was kissing her was young in\nsemblance and unwrinkled, and lovely to look on, with plenteous long hair\nof the hue of ripe barley, and clad in glistening raiment such as has\nbeen woven in no loom on earth.\n\nAnd indeed it was the Wood-Sun in the semblance of a crone, who had come\nto gather wisdom of the coming time from the foreseeing of the Hall-Sun;\nsince now at last she herself foresaw nothing of it, though she was of\nthe kindred of the Gods and the Fathers of the Goths.  So when she had\nheard the Hall-Sun she deemed that she knew but too well what her words\nmeant, and what for love, what for sorrow, she grew sick at heart as she\nheard them.\n\nSo at last she arose and turned to look at the Great Roof; and strong and\nstraight, and cool and dark grey showed its ridge against the pale sky of\nthe summer afternoon all quivering with the heat of many hours' sun: dark\nshowed its windows as she gazed on it, and stark and stiff she knew were\nits pillars within.\n\nThen she said aloud, but to herself: \"What then if a merry and mighty\nlife be given for it, and the sorrow of the people be redeemed; yet will\nnot I give the life which is his; nay rather let him give the bliss which\nis mine.  But oh! how may it be that he shall die joyous and I shall live\nunhappy!\"\n\nThen she went slowly down from the Hill of Speech, and whoso saw her\ndeemed her but a gangrel carline.  So she went her ways and let the wood\ncover her.\n\nBut in a little while the Hall-Sun awoke alone, and sat up with a sigh,\nand she remembered nothing concerning her sight of the flickering flame\nalong the hall-roof, and the fire-tongues like strips of scarlet cloth\nblown by the wind, nor had she any memory of her words concerning the\ncoming day.  But the rest of her talk with the carline she remembered,\nand also the vision of the beautiful woman who had kissed and embraced\nher; and she knew that it was her very mother.  Also she perceived that\nshe had been weeping, therefore she knew that she had uttered words of\nwisdom.  For so it fared with her at whiles, that she knew not her own\nwords of foretelling, but spoke them out as if in a dream.\n\nSo now she went down from the Hill of Speech soberly, and turned toward\nthe Woman's door of the hall, and on her way she met the women and old\nmen and youths coming back from the meadow with little mirth: and there\nwere many of them who looked shyly at her as though they would gladly\nhave asked her somewhat, and yet durst not.  But for her, her sadness\npassed away when she came among them, and she looked kindly on this and\nthat one of them, and entered with them into the Woman's Chamber, and did\nwhat came to her hand to do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THEY TALK ON THE WAY TO THE FOLK-THING\n\n\nAll day long one standing on the Speech-hill of the Wolfings might have\nseen men in their war-array streaming along the side of Mirkwood-water,\non both sides thereof; and the last comers from the Nether-mark came\nhastening all they might; for they would not be late at the\ntrysting-place.  But these were of a kindred called the Laxings, who bore\na salmon on their banner; and they were somewhat few in number, for they\nhad but of late years become a House of the Markmen.  Their banner-wain\nwas drawn by white horses, fleet and strong, and they were no great band,\nfor they had but few thralls with them, and all, free men and thralls,\nwere a-horseback; so they rode by hastily with their banner-wain, their\nfew munition-wains following as they might.\n\nNow tells the tale of the men-at-arms of the Wolfings and the Beamings,\nthat soon they fell in with the Elking host, which was journeying but\nleisurely, so that the Wolfings might catch up with them: they were a\nvery great kindred, the most numerous of all Mid-mark, and at this time\nthey had affinity with the Wolfings.  But old men of the House remembered\nhow they had heard their grandsires and very old men tell that there had\nbeen a time when the Elking House had been established by men from out of\nthe Wolfing kindred, and how they had wandered away from the Mark in the\ndays when it had been first settled, and had abided aloof for many\ngenerations of men; and so at last had come back again to the Mark, and\nhad taken up their habitation at a place in Mid-mark where was dwelling\nbut a remnant of a House called the Thyrings, who had once been exceeding\nmighty, but had by that time almost utterly perished in a great sickness\nwhich befel in those days.  So then these two Houses, the wanderers come\nback and the remnant left by the sickness of the Gods, made one House\ntogether, and increased and throve after their coming together, and\nwedded with the Wolfings, and became a very great House.\n\nGallant and glorious was their array now, as they marched along with\ntheir banner of the Elk, which was drawn by the very beasts themselves\ntamed to draught to that end through many generations; they were fatter\nand sleeker than their wild-wood brethren, but not so mighty.\n\nSo were the men of the three kindreds somewhat mingled together on the\nway.  The Wolfings were the tallest and the biggest made; but of those\ndark-haired men aforesaid, were there fewest amongst the Beamings, and\nmost among the Elkings, as though they had drawn to them more men of\nalien blood during their wanderings aforesaid.  So they talked together\nand made each other good cheer, as is the wont of companions in arms on\nthe eve of battle; and the talk ran, as may be deemed, on that journey\nand what was likely to come of it: and spake an Elking warrior to a\nWolfing by whom he rode:\n\n\"O Wolfkettle, hath the Hall-Sun had any foresight of the day of battle?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the other, \"when she lighted the farewell candle, she bade us\ncome back again, and spoke of the day of our return; but that methinks,\nas thou and I would talk of it, thinking what would be likely to befal.\nSince we are a great host of valiant men, and these Welshmen {2} most\nvaliant, and as the rumour runneth bigger-bodied men than the Hun-folk,\nand so well ordered as never folk have been.  So then if we overthrow\nthem we shall come back again; and if they overthrow us, the remnant of\nus shall fall back before them till we come to our habitations; for it is\nnot to be looked for that they will fall in upon our rear and prevent us,\nsince we have the thicket of the wild-wood on our flanks.\"\n\n\"Sooth is that,\" said the Elking; \"and as to the mightiness of this folk\nand their customs, ye may gather somewhat from the songs which our House\nyet singeth, and which ye have heard wide about in the Mark; for this is\nthe same folk of which a many of them tell, making up that story-lay\nwhich is called the South-Welsh Lay; which telleth how we have met this\nfolk in times past when we were in fellowship with a folk of the Welsh of\nlike customs to ourselves: for we of the Elkings were then but a feeble\nfolk.  So we marched with this folk of the Kymry and met the men of the\ncities, and whiles we overthrew and whiles were overthrown, but at last\nin a great battle were overthrown with so great a slaughter, that the red\nblood rose over the wheels of the wains, and the city-folk fainted with\nthe work of the slaughter, as men who mow a match in the meadows when the\nswathes are dry and heavy and the afternoon of midsummer is hot; and\nthere they stood and stared on the field of the slain, and knew not\nwhether they were in Home or Hell, so fierce the fight had been.\"\n\nTherewith a man of the Beamings, who was riding on the other side of the\nElking, reached out over his horse's neck and said:\n\n\"Yea friend, but is there not some telling of a tale concerning how ye\nand your fellowship took the great city of the Welshmen of the South, and\ndwelt there long.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the Elking, \"Hearken how it is told in the South-Welsh Lay:\n\n      \"'Have ye not heard\n      Of the ways of Weird?\n      How the folk fared forth\n      Far away from the North?\n      And as light as one wendeth\n      Whereas the wood endeth,\n      When of nought is our need,\n      And none telleth our deed,\n   So Rodgeir unwearied and Reidfari wan\n   The town where none tarried the shield-shaking man.\n   All lonely the street there, and void was the way\n   And nought hindered our feet but the dead men that lay\n   Under shield in the lanes of the houses heavens-high,\n   All the ring-bearing swains that abode there to die.'\n\n\"Tells the Lay, that none abode the Goths and their fellowship, but such\nas were mighty enough to fall before them, and the rest, both man and\nwoman, fled away before our folk and before the folk of the Kymry, and\nleft their town for us to dwell in; as saith the Lay:\n\n      \"'Glistening of gold\n      Did men's eyen behold;\n      Shook the pale sword\n      O'er the unspoken word,\n      No man drew nigh us\n      With weapon to try us,\n      For the Welsh-wrought shield\n      Lay low on the field.\n   By man's hand unbuilded all seemed there to be,\n   The walls ruddy gilded, the pearls of the sea:\n   Yea all things were dead there save pillar and wall,\n   But _they_ lived and _they_ said us the song of the hall;\n   The dear hall left to perish by men of the land,\n   For the Goth-folk to cherish with gold gaining hand.'\n\n\"See ye how the Lay tells that the hall was bolder than the men, who fled\nfrom it, and left all for our fellowship to deal with in the days gone\nby?\"\n\nSaid the Wolfing man:\n\n\"And as it was once, so shall it be again.  Maybe we shall go far on this\njourney, and see at least one of the garths of the Southlands, even those\nwhich they call cities.  For I have heard it said that they have more\ncities than one only, and that so great are their kindreds, that each\nliveth in a garth full of mighty houses, with a wall of stone and lime\naround it; and that in every one of these garths lieth wealth untold\nheaped up.  And wherefore should not all this fall to the Markmen and\ntheir valiancy?\"\n\nSaid the Elking:\n\n\"As to their many cities and the wealth of them, that is sooth; but as to\neach city being the habitation of each kindred, it is otherwise: for\nrather it may be said of them that they have forgotten kindred, and have\nnone, nor do they heed whom they wed, and great is the confusion amongst\nthem.  And mighty men among them ordain where they shall dwell, and what\nshall be their meat, and how long they shall labour after they are weary,\nand in all wise what manner of life shall be amongst them; and though\nthey be called free men who suffer this, yet may no house or kindred\ngainsay this rule and order.  In sooth they are a people mighty, but\nunhappy.\"\n\nSaid Wolfkettle:\n\n\"And hast thou learned all this from the ancient story lays, O Hiarandi?\nFor some of them I know, though not all, and therein have I noted nothing\nof all this.  Is there some new minstrel arisen in thine House of a\nmemory excelling all those that have gone before?  If that be so, I bid\nhim to the Roof of the Wolfings as soon as may be; for we lack new\ntales.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Hiarandi, \"This that I tell thee is not a tale of past days,\nbut a tale of to-day.  For there came to us a man from out of the wild-\nwood, and prayed us peace, and we gave it him; and he told us that he was\nof a House of the Gael, and that his House had been in a great battle\nagainst these Welshmen, whom he calleth the Romans; and that he was taken\nin the battle, and sold as a thrall in one of their garths; and howbeit,\nit was not their master-garth, yet there he learned of their customs: and\nsore was the lesson!  Hard was his life amongst them, for their thralls\nbe not so well entreated as their draught-beasts, so many do they take in\nbattle; for they are a mighty folk; and these thralls and those aforesaid\nunhappy freemen do all tilling and herding and all deeds of\ncraftsmanship: and above these are men whom they call masters and lords\nwho do nought, nay not so much as smithy their own edge-weapons, but\nlinger out their days in their dwellings and out of their dwellings,\nlying about in the sun or the hall-cinders, like cur-dogs who have fallen\naway from kind.\n\n\"So this man made a shift to flee away from out of that garth, since it\nwas not far from the great river; and being a valiant man, and young and\nmighty of body, he escaped all perils and came to us through the\nMirkwood.  But we saw that he was no liar, and had been very evilly\nhandled, for upon his body was the mark of many a stripe, and of the\nshackles that had been soldered on to his limbs; also it was more than\none of these accursed people whom he had slain when he fled.  So he\nbecame our guest and we loved him, and he dwelt among us and yet\ndwelleth, for we have taken him into our House.  But yesterday he was\nsick and might not ride with us; but may be he will follow on and catch\nup with us in a day or two.  And if he come not, then will I bring him\nover to the Wolfings when the battle is done.\"\n\nThen laughed the Beaming man, and spake:\n\n\"How then if ye come not back, nor Wolfkettle, nor the Welsh Guest, nor I\nmyself?  Meseemeth no one of these Southland Cities shall we behold, and\nno more of the Southlanders than their war-array.\"\n\n\"These are evil words,\" said Wolfkettle, \"though such an outcome must be\nthought on.  But why deemest thou this?\"\n\nSaid the Beaming: \"There is no Hall-Sun sitting under our Roof at home to\ntell true tales concerning the Kindred every day.  Yet forsooth from time\nto time is a word said in our Folk-hall for good or for evil; and who can\nchoose but hearken thereto?  And yestereve was a woeful word spoken, and\nthat by a man-child of ten winters.\"\n\nSaid the Elking: \"Now that thou hast told us thus much, thou must tell us\nmore, yea, all the word which was spoken; else belike we shall deem of it\nas worse than it was.\"\n\nSaid the Beaming: \"Thus it was; this little lad brake out weeping\nyestereve, when the Hall was full and feasting; and he wailed, and roared\nout, as children do, and would not be pacified, and when he was asked why\nhe made that to do, he said: 'Well away!  Raven hath promised to make me\na clay horse and to bake it in the kiln with the pots next week; and now\nhe goeth to the war, and he shall never come back, and never shall my\nhorse be made.'  Thereat we all laughed as ye may well deem.  But the lad\nmade a sour countenance on us and said, 'why do ye laugh? look yonder,\nwhat see ye?'  'Nay,' said one, 'nought but the Feast-hall wall and the\nhangings of the High-tide thereon.'  Then said the lad sobbing: 'Ye see\nill: further afield see I: I see a little plain, on a hill top, and fells\nbeyond it far bigger than our speech-hill: and there on the plain lieth\nRaven as white as parchment; and none hath such hue save the dead.'  Then\nsaid Raven, (and he was a young man, and was standing thereby).  'And\nwell is that, swain, to die in harness!  Yet hold up thine heart; here is\nGunbert who shall come back and bake thine horse for thee.'  'Nay never\nmore,' quoth the child, 'For I see his pale head lying at Raven's feet;\nbut his body with the green gold-broidered kirtle I see not.'  Then was\nthe laughter stilled, and man after man drew near to the child, and\nquestioned him, and asked, 'dost thou see me?' 'dost thou see me?'  And\nhe failed to see but few of those that asked him.  Therefore now\nmeseemeth that not many of us shall see the cities of the South, and\nthose few belike shall look on their own shackles therewithal.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Hiarandi, \"What is all this? heard ye ever of a company of\nfighting men that fared afield, and found the foe, and came back home\nleaving none behind them?\"\n\nSaid the Beaming: \"Yet seldom have I heard a child foretell the death of\nwarriors.  I tell thee that hadst thou been there, thou wouldst have\nthought of it as if the world were coming to an end.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Wolfkettle, \"let it be as it may!  Yet at least I will not\nbe led away from the field by the foemen.  Oft may a man be hindered of\nvictory, but never of death if he willeth it.\"\n\nTherewith he handled a knife that hung about his neck, and went on to\nsay: \"But indeed, I do much marvel that no word came into the mouth of\nthe Hall-Sun yestereven or this morning, but such as any woman of the\nkindred might say.\"\n\nTherewith fell their talk awhile, and as they rode they came to where the\nwood drew nigher to the river, and thus the Mid-mark had an end; for\nthere was no House had a dwelling in the Mid-mark higher up the water\nthan the Elkings, save one only, not right great, who mostly fared to war\nalong with the Elkings: and this was the Oselings, whose banner bore the\nimage of the Wood-ousel, the black bird with the yellow neb; and they had\njust fallen into the company of the greater House.\n\nSo now Mid-mark was over and past, and the serried trees of the wood came\ndown like a wall but a little way from the lip of the water; and\nscattered trees, mostly quicken-trees grew here and there on the very\nwater side.  But Mirkwood-water ran deep swift and narrow between high\nclean-cloven banks, so that none could dream of fording, and not so many\nof swimming its dark green dangerous waters.  And the day wore on towards\nevening and the glory of the western sky was unseen because of the wall\nof high trees.  And still the host made on, and because of the narrowness\nof the space between river and wood it was strung out longer and looked a\nvery great company of men.  And moreover the men of the eastern-lying\npart of Mid-mark, were now marching thick and close on the other side of\nthe river but a little way from the Wolfings and their fellows; for\nnothing but the narrow river sundered them.\n\nSo night fell, and the stars shone, and the moon rose, and yet the\nWolfings and their fellows stayed not, since they wotted that behind them\nfollowed a many of the men of the Mark, both the Mid and the Nether, and\nthey would by no means hinder their march.\n\nSo wended the Markmen between wood and stream on either side of Mirkwood-\nwater, till now at last the night grew deep and the moon set, and it was\nhard on midnight, and they had kindled many torches to light them on\neither side of the water.  So whereas they had come to a place where the\ntrees gave back somewhat from the river, which was well-grassed for their\nhorses and neat, and was called Baitmead, the companies on the western\nside made stay there till morning.  And they drew the wains right up to\nthe thick of the wood, and all men turned aside into the mead from the\nbeaten road, so that those who were following after might hold on their\nway if so they would.  There then they appointed watchers of the night,\nwhile the rest of them lay upon the sward by the side of the trees, and\nslept through the short summer night.\n\nThe tale tells not that any man dreamed of the fight to come in such wise\nthat there was much to tell of his dream on the morrow; many dreamed of\nno fight or faring to war, but of matters little, and often laughable,\nmere mingled memories of bygone time that had no waking wits to marshal\nthem.\n\nBut that man of the Beamings dreamed that he was at home watching a\npotter, a man of the thralls of the House working at his wheel, and\nfashioning bowls and ewers: and he had a mind to take of his clay and\nfashion a horse for the lad that had bemoaned the promise of his toy.  And\nhe tried long and failed to fashion anything; for the clay fell to pieces\nin his hands; till at last it held together and grew suddenly, not into\nan image of a horse, but of the Great Yule Boar, the similitude of the\nHoly Beast of Frey.  So he laughed in his sleep and was glad, and leaped\nup and drew his sword with his clay-stained hands that he might wave it\nover the Earth Boar, and swear a great oath of a doughty deed.  And\ntherewith he found himself standing on his feet indeed, just awakened in\nthe cold dawn, and holding by his right hand to an ash-sapling that grew\nbeside him.  So he laughed again, and laid him down, and leaned back and\nslept his sleep out till the sun and the voices of his fellows stirring\nawakened him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THEY GATHER TO THE FOLK-MOTE\n\n\nWhen it was the morning, all the host of the Markmen was astir on either\nside of the water, and when they had broken their fast, they got speedily\ninto array, and were presently on the road again; and the host was now\nstrung out longer yet, for the space between water and wood once more\ndiminished till at last it was no wider than ten men might go abreast,\nand looking ahead it was as if the wild-wood swallowed up both river and\nroad.\n\nBut the fighting-men hastened on merrily with their hearts raised high,\nsince they knew that they would soon be falling in with more of their\npeople, and the coming fight was growing a clearer picture to their eyes;\nso from side to side of the river they shouted out the cries of their\nHouses, or friend called to friend across the eddies of Mirkwood-water,\nand there was game and glee enough.\n\nSo they fared till the wood gave way before them, and lo, the beginning\nof another plain, somewhat like the Mid-mark.  There also the water\nwidened out before them, and there were eyots in it with stony shores\ncrowned with willow or with alder, and aspens rising from the midst of\nthem.\n\nBut as for the plain, it was thus much different from Mid-mark, that the\nwood which begirt it rose on the south into low hills, and away beyond\nthem were other hills blue in the distance, for the most bare of wood,\nand not right high, the pastures of the wild-bull and the bison, whereas\nnow dwelt a folk somewhat scattered and feeble; hunters and herdsmen,\nwith little tillage about their abodes, a folk akin to the Markmen and\nallied to them.  They had come into those parts later than the Markmen,\nas the old tales told; which said moreover that in days gone by a folk\ndwelt among those hills who were alien from the Goths, and great foes to\nthe Markmen; and how that on a time they came down from their hills with\na great host, together with new-comers of their own blood, and made their\nway through the wild-wood, and fell upon the Upper-mark; and how that\nthere befel a fearful battle that endured for three days; and the first\nday the Aliens worsted the Markmen, who were but a few, since they were\nthey of the Upper-mark only.  So the Aliens burned their houses and slew\ntheir old men, and drave off many of their women and children; and the\nremnant of the men of the Upper-mark with all that they had, which was\nnow but little, took refuge in an island of Mirkwood-water, where they\nfenced themselves as well as they could for that night; for they expected\nthe succour of their kindred of the Mid-mark and the Nether-mark, unto\nwhom they had sped the war-arrow when they first had tidings of the onset\nof the Aliens.\n\nSo at the sun-rising they sacrificed to the Gods twenty chieftains of the\nAliens whom they had taken, and therewithal a maiden of their own\nkindred, the daughter of their war-duke, that she might lead that mighty\ncompany to the House of the Gods; and thereto was she nothing loth, but\nwent right willingly.\n\nThere then they awaited the onset.  But the men of Mid-mark came up in\nthe morning, when the battle was but just joined, and fell on so fiercely\nthat the aliens gave back, and then they of the Upper-mark stormed out of\ntheir eyot, and fell on over the ford, and fought till the water ran red\nwith their blood, and the blood of the foemen.  So the Aliens gave back\nbefore the onset of the Markmen all over the meads; but when they came to\nthe hillocks and the tofts of the half-burned habitations, and the wood\nwas on their flank, they made a stand again, and once more the battle\nwaxed hot, for they were very many, and had many bowmen: there fell the\nWar-duke of the Markmen, whose daughter had been offered up for victory,\nand his name was Agni, so that the tofts where he fell have since been\ncalled Agni's Tofts.  So that day they fought all over the plain, and a\ngreat many died, both of the Aliens and the Markmen, and though these\nlast were victorious, yet when the sun went down there still were the\nAliens abiding in the Upper-mark, fenced by their wain-burg, beaten, and\nmuch diminished in number, but still a host of men: while of the Markmen\nmany had fallen, and many more were hurt, because the Aliens were good\nbowmen.\n\nBut on the morrow again, as the old tale told, came up the men of the\nNether-mark fresh and unwounded; and so the battle began again on the\nsouthern limit of the Upper-mark where the Aliens had made their wain-\nburg.  But not long did it endure; for the Markmen fell on so fiercely,\nthat they stormed over the wain-burg, and slew all before them, and there\nwas a very great slaughter of the Aliens; so great, tells the old tale,\nthat never again durst they meet the Markmen in war.\n\nThus went forth the host of the Markmen, faring along both sides of the\nwater into the Upper-mark; and on the west side, where went the Wolfings,\nthe ground now rose by a long slope into a low hill, and when they came\nunto the brow thereof, they beheld before them the whole plain of the\nUpper-mark, and the dwellings of the kindred therein all girdled about by\nthe wild-wood; and beyond, the blue hills of the herdsmen, and beyond\nthem still, a long way aloof, lying like a white cloud on the verge of\nthe heavens, the snowy tops of the great mountains.  And as they looked\ndown on to the plain they saw it embroidered, as it were, round about the\nhabitations which lay within ken by crowds of many people, and the\nbanners of the kindreds and the arms of men; and many a place they saw\nnamed after the ancient battle and that great slaughter of the Aliens.\n\nOn their left hand lay the river, and as it now fairly entered with them\ninto the Upper-mark, it spread out into wide rippling shallows beset with\nyet more sandy eyots, amongst which was one much greater, rising amidmost\ninto a low hill, grassy and bare of tree or bush; and this was the island\nwhereon the Markmen stood on the first day of the Great Battle, and it\nwas now called the Island of the Gods.\n\nThereby was the ford, which was firm and good and changed little from\nyear to year, so that all Markmen knew it well and it was called\nBattleford: thereover now crossed all the eastern companies, footmen and\nhorsemen, freemen and thralls, wains and banners, with shouting and\nlaughter, and the noise of horns and the lowing of neat, till all that\nplain's end was flooded with the host of the Markmen.\n\nBut when the eastern-abiders had crossed, they made no stay, but went\nduly ordered about their banners, winding on toward the first of the\nabodes on the western side of the water; because it was but a little way\nsouthwest of this that the Thing-stead of the Upper-mark lay; and the\nwhole Folk was summoned thither when war threatened from the South, just\nas it was called to the Thing-stead of the Nether-mark, when the threat\nof war came from the North.  But the western companies stayed on the brow\nof that low hill till all the eastern men were over the river, and on\ntheir way to the Thing-stead, and then they moved on.\n\nSo came the Wolfings and their fellows up to the dwellings of the\nnorthernmost kindred, who were called the Daylings, and bore on their\nbanner the image of the rising sun.  Thereabout was the Mark somewhat\nmore hilly and broken than in the Mid-mark, so that the Great Roof of the\nDaylings, which was a very big house, stood on a hillock whose sides had\nbeen cleft down sheer on all sides save one (which was left as a bridge)\nby the labour of men, and it was a very defensible place.\n\nThereon were now gathered round about the Roof all the stay-at-homes of\nthe kindred, who greeted with joyous cries the men-at-arms as they\npassed.  Albeit one very old man, who sat in a chair near to the edge of\nthe sheer hill looking on the war array, when he saw the Wolfing banner\ndraw near, stood up to gaze on it, and then shook his head sadly, and\nsank back again into his chair, and covered his face with his hands: and\nwhen the folk saw that, a silence bred of the coldness of fear fell on\nthem, for that elder was deemed a foreseeing man.\n\nBut as those three fellows, of whose talk of yesterday the tale has told,\ndrew near and beheld what the old carle did (for they were riding\ntogether this day also) the Beaming man laid his hand on Wolfkettle's\nrein and said:\n\n\"Lo you, neighbour, if thy Vala hath seen nought, yet hath this old man\nseen somewhat, and that somewhat even as the little lad saw it.  Many a\nmother's son shall fall before the Welshmen.\"\n\nBut Wolfkettle shook his rein free, and his face reddened as of one who\nis angry, yet he kept silence, while the Elking said:\n\n\"Let be, Toti! for he that lives shall tell the tale to the foreseers,\nand shall make them wiser than they are to-day.\"\n\nThen laughed Toti, as one who would not be thought to be too heedful of\nthe morrow.  But Wolfkettle brake out into speech and rhyme, and said:\n\n   \"O warriors, the Wolfing kindred shall live or it shall die;\n   And alive it shall be as the oak-tree when the summer storm goes by;\n   But dead it shall be as its bole, that they hew for the corner-post\n   Of some fair and mighty folk-hall, and the roof of a war-fain host.\"\n\nSo therewith they rode their ways past the abode of the Daylings.\n\nStraight to the wood went all the host, and so into it by a wide way\ncleft through the thicket, and in some thirty minutes they came thereby\ninto a great wood-lawn cleared amidst of it by the work of men's hands.\nThere already was much of the host gathered, sitting or standing in a\ngreat ring round about a space bare of men, where amidmost rose a great\nmound raised by men's hands and wrought into steps to be the\nsitting-places of the chosen elders and chief men of the kindred; and\natop the mound was flat and smooth save for a turf bench or seat that\nwent athwart it whereon ten men might sit.\n\nAll the wains save the banner-wains had been left behind at the Dayling\nabode, nor was any beast there save the holy beasts who drew the banner-\nwains and twenty white horses, that stood wreathed about with flowers\nwithin the ring of warriors, and these were for the burnt offering to be\ngiven to the Gods for a happy day of battle.  Even the war-horses of the\nhost they must leave in the wood without the wood-lawn, and all men were\nafoot who were there.\n\nFor this was the Thing-stead of the Upper-mark, and the holiest place of\nthe Markmen, and no beast, either neat, sheep, or horse might pasture\nthere, but was straightway slain and burned if he wandered there; nor\nmight any man eat therein save at the holy feasts when offerings were\nmade to the Gods.\n\nSo the Wolfings took their place there in the ring of men with the\nElkings on their right hand and the Beamings on their left.  And in the\nmidst of the Wolfing array stood Thiodolf clad in the dwarf-wrought\nhauberk: but his head was bare; for he had sworn over the Cup of Renown\nthat he would fight unhelmed throughout all that trouble, and would bear\nno shield in any battle thereof however fierce the onset might be.\n\nShort, and curling close to his head was his black hair, a little\ngrizzled, so that it looked like rings of hard dark iron: his forehead\nwas high and smooth, his lips full and red, his eyes steady and\nwide-open, and all his face joyous with the thought of the fame of his\ndeeds, and the coming battle with a foeman whom the Markmen knew not yet.\n\nHe was tall and wide-shouldered, but so exceeding well fashioned of all\nhis limbs and body that he looked no huge man.  He was a man well beloved\nof women, and children would mostly run to him gladly and play with him.\nA most fell warrior was he, whose deeds no man of the Mark could equal,\nbut blithe of speech even when he was sorrowful of mood, a man that knew\nnot bitterness of heart: and for all his exceeding might and valiancy, he\nwas proud and high to no man; so that the very thralls loved him.\n\nHe was not abounding in words in the field; nor did he use much the\ncustom of those days in reviling and defying with words the foe that was\nto be smitten with swords.\n\nThere were those who had seen him in the field for the first time who\ndeemed him slack at the work: for he would not always press on with the\nforemost, but would hold him a little aback, and while the battle was\nyoung he forbore to smite, and would do nothing but help a kinsman who\nwas hard pressed, or succour the wounded.  So that if men were dealing\nwith no very hard matter, and their hearts were high and overweening, he\nwould come home at whiles with unbloodied blade.  But no man blamed him\nsave those who knew him not: for his intent was that the younger men\nshould win themselves fame, and so raise their courage, and become high-\nhearted and stout.\n\nBut when the stour was hard, and the battle was broken, and the hearts of\nmen began to fail them, and doubt fell upon the Markmen, then was he\nanother man to see: wise, but swift and dangerous, rushing on as if shot\nout by some mighty engine: heedful of all, on either side and in front;\nrunning hither and thither as the fight failed and the fire of battle\nfaltered; his sword so swift and deadly that it was as if he wielded the\nvery lightening of the heavens: for with the sword it was ever his wont\nto fight.\n\nBut it must be said that when the foemen turned their backs, and the\nchase began, then Thiodolf would nowise withhold his might as in the\nearly battle, but ever led the chase, and smote on the right hand and on\nthe left, sparing none, and crying out to the men of the kindred not to\nweary in their work, but to fulfil all the hours of their day.\n\nFor thuswise would he say and this was a word of his:\n\n   \"Let us rest to-morrow, fellows, since to-day we have fought amain!\n   Let not these men we have smitten come aback on our hands again,\n   And say 'Ye Wolfing warriors, ye have done your work but ill,\n   Fall to now and do it again, like the craftsman who learneth his\n   skill.'\"\n\nSuch then was Thiodolf, and ever was he the chosen leader of the Wolfings\nand often the War-duke of the whole Folk.\n\nBy his side stood the other chosen leader, whose name was Heriulf; a man\nwell stricken in years, but very mighty and valiant; wise in war and well\nrenowned; of few words save in battle, and therein a singer of songs, a\nlaugher, a joyous man, a merry companion.  He was a much bigger man than\nThiodolf; and indeed so huge was his stature, that he seemed to be of the\nkindred of the Mountain Giants; and his bodily might went with his\nstature, so that no one man might deal with him body to body.  His face\nwas big; his cheek-bones high; his nose like an eagle's neb, his mouth\nwide, his chin square and big; his eyes light-grey and fierce under\nshaggy eyebrows: his hair white and long.\n\nSuch were his raiment and weapons, that he wore a coat of fence of dark\niron scales sewn on to horse-hide, and a dark iron helm fashioned above\nhis brow into the similitude of the Wolf's head with gaping jaws; and\nthis he had wrought for himself with his own hands, for he was a good\nsmith.  A round buckler he bore and a huge twibill, which no man of the\nkindred could well wield save himself; and it was done both blade and\nshaft with knots and runes in gold; and he loved that twibill well, and\ncalled it the Wolf's Sister.\n\nThere then stood Heriulf, looking no less than one of the forefathers of\nthe kindred come back again to the battle of the Wolfings.\n\nHe was well-beloved for his wondrous might, and he was no hard man,\nthough so fell a warrior, and though of few words, as aforesaid, was a\nblithe companion to old and young.  In numberless battles had he fought,\nand men deemed it a wonder that Odin had not taken to him a man so much\nafter his own heart; and they said it was neighbourly done of the Father\nof the Slain to forbear his company so long, and showed how well he loved\nthe Wolfing House.\n\nFor a good while yet came other bands of Markmen into the Thing-stead;\nbut at last there was an end of their coming.  Then the ring of men\nopened, and ten warriors of the Daylings made their way through it, and\none of them, the oldest, bore in his hand the War-horn of the Daylings;\nfor this kindred had charge of the Thing-stead, and of all appertaining\nto it.  So while his nine fellows stood round about the Speech-Hill, the\nold warrior clomb up to the topmost of it, and blew a blast on the horn.\nThereon they who were sitting rose up, and they who were talking each to\neach held their peace, and the whole ring drew nigher to the hill, so\nthat there was a clear space behind them 'twixt them and the wood, and a\nspace before them between them and the hill, wherein were those nine\nwarriors, and the horses for the burnt-offering, and the altar of the\nGods; and now were all well within ear-shot of a man speaking amidst the\nsilence in a clear voice.\n\nBut there were gathered of the Markmen to that place some four thousand\nmen, all chosen warriors and doughty men; and of the thralls and aliens\ndwelling with them they were leading two thousand.  But not all of the\nfreemen of the Upper-mark could be at the Thing; for needs must there be\nsome guard to the passes of the wood toward the south and the hills of\nthe herdsmen, whereas it was no wise impassable to a wisely led host: so\nfive hundred men, what of freemen, what of thralls, abode there to guard\nthe wild-wood; and these looked to have some helping from the hill-men.\n\nNow came an ancient warrior into the space between the men and the wild-\nwood holding in his hand a kindled torch; and first he faced due south by\nthe sun, then, turning, he slowly paced the whole circle going from east\nto west, and so on till he had reached the place he started from: then he\ndashed the torch to the ground and quenched the fire, and so went his\nways to his own company again.\n\nThen the old Dayling warrior on the mound-top drew his sword, and waved\nit flashing in the sun toward the four quarters of the heavens; and\nthereafter blew again a blast on the War-horn.  Then fell utter silence\non the whole assembly, and the wood was still around them, save here and\nthere the stamping of a war-horse or the sound of his tugging at the\nwoodland grass; for there was little resort of birds to the depths of the\nthicket, and the summer morning was windless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE MARKMEN\n\n\nSo the Dayling warrior lifted up his voice and said:\n\n   \"O kindreds of the Markmen, hearken the words I say;\n   For no chancehap assembly is gathered here to-day.\n   The fire hath gone around us in the hands of our very kin,\n   And twice the horn hath sounded, and the Thing is hallowed in.\n   Will ye hear or forbear to hearken the tale there is to tell?\n   There are many mouths to tell it, and a many know it well.\n   And the tale is this, that the foemen against our kindreds fare\n   Who eat the meadows desert, and burn the desert bare.\"\n\nThen sat he down on the turf seat; but there arose a murmur in the\nassembly as of men eager to hearken; and without more ado came a man out\nof a company of the Upper-mark, and clomb up to the top of the Speech-\nHill, and spoke in a loud voice:\n\n\"I am Bork, a man of the Geirings of the Upper-mark: two days ago I and\nfive others were in the wild-wood a-hunting, and we wended through the\nthicket, and came into the land of the hill-folk; and after we had gone a\nwhile we came to a long dale with a brook running through it, and yew-\ntrees scattered about it and a hazel copse at one end; and by the copse\nwas a band of men who had women and children with them, and a few neat,\nand fewer horses; but sheep were feeding up and down the dale; and they\nhad made them booths of turf and boughs, and were making ready their\ncooking fires, for it was evening.  So when they saw us, they ran to\ntheir arms, but we cried out to them in the tongue of the Goths and bade\nthem peace.  Then they came up the bent to us and spake to us in the\nGothic tongue, albeit a little diversely from us; and when we had told\nthem what and whence we were, they were glad of us, and bade us to them,\nand we went, and they entreated us kindly, and made us such cheer as they\nmight, and gave us mutton to eat, and we gave them venison of the wild-\nwood which we had taken, and we abode with them there that night.\n\n\"But they told us that they were a house of the folk of the herdsmen, and\nthat there was war in the land, and that the people thereof were fleeing\nbefore the cruelty of a host of warriors, men of a mighty folk, such as\nthe earth hath not heard of, who dwell in great cities far to the south;\nand how that this host had crossed the mountains, and the Great Water\nthat runneth from them, and had fallen upon their kindred, and overcome\ntheir fighting-men, and burned their dwellings, slain their elders, and\ndriven their neat and their sheep, yea, and their women and children in\nno better wise than their neat and sheep.\n\n\"And they said that they had fled away thus far from their old\nhabitations, which were a long way to the south, and were now at point to\nbuild them dwellings there in that Dale of the Hazels, and to trust to it\nthat these Welshmen, whom they called Romans, would not follow so far,\nand that if they did, they might betake them to the wild-wood, and let\nthe thicket cover them, they being so nigh to it.\n\n\"Thus they told us; wherefore we sent back one of our fellowship, Birsti\nof the Geirings, to tell the tale; and one of the herdsmen folk went with\nhim, but we ourselves went onward to hear more of these Romans; for the\nfolk when we asked them, said that they had been in battle against them,\nbut had fled away for fear of their rumour only.  Therefore we went on,\nand a young man of this kindred, who named themselves the Hrutings of the\nFell-folk, went along with us.  But the others were sore afeard, for all\nthey had weapons.\n\n\"So as we went up the land we found they had told us the very sooth, and\nwe met divers Houses, and bands, and broken men, who were fleeing from\nthis trouble, and many of them poor and in misery, having lost their\nflocks and herds as well as their roofs; and this last be but little loss\nto them, as their dwellings are but poor, and for the most part they have\nno tillage.  Now of these men, we met not a few who had been in battle\nwith the Roman host, and much they told us of their might not to be dealt\nwith, and their mishandling of those whom they took, both men and women;\nand at the last we heard true tidings how they had raised them a garth,\nand made a stronghold in the midst of the land, as men who meant abiding\nthere, so that neither might the winter drive them aback, and that they\nmight be succoured by their people on the other side of the Great River;\nto which end they have made other garths, though not so great, on the\nroad to that water, and all these well and wisely warded by tried men.\nFor as to the Folks on the other side of the Water, all these lie under\ntheir hand already, what by fraud what by force, and their warriors go\nwith them to the battle and help them; of whom we met bands now and\nagain, and fought with them, and took men of them, who told us all this\nand much more, over long to tell of here.\"\n\nHe paused and turned about to look on the mighty assembly, and his ears\ndrank in the long murmur that followed his speaking, and when it had died\nout he spake again, but in rhyme:\n\n   \"Lo thus much of my tidings!  But this too it behoveth to tell,\n   That these masterful men of the cities of the Markmen know full well:\n   And they wot of the well-grassed meadows, and the acres of the Mark,\n   And our life amidst of the wild-wood like a candle in the dark;\n   And they know of our young men's valour and our women's loveliness,\n   And our tree would they spoil with destruction if its fruit they may\n   never possess.\n   For their lust is without a limit, and nought may satiate\n   Their ravening maw; and their hunger if ye check it turneth to hate,\n   And the blood-fever burns in their bosoms, and torment and anguish and\n   woe\n   O'er the wide field ploughed by the sword-blade for the coming years\n   they sow;\n   And ruth is a thing forgotten and all hopes they trample down;\n   And whatso thing is steadfast, whatso of good renown,\n   Whatso is fair and lovely, whatso is ancient sooth\n   In the bloody marl shall they mingle as they laugh for lack of ruth.\n   Lo the curse of the world cometh hither; for the men that we took in\n   the land\n   Said thus, that their host is gathering with many an ordered band\n   To fall on the wild-wood passes and flood the lovely Mark,\n   As the river over the meadows upriseth in the dark.\n   Look to it, O ye kindred! availeth now no word\n   But the voice of the clashing of iron, and the sword-blade on the\n   sword.\"\n\nTherewith he made an end, and deeper and longer was the murmur of the\nhost of freemen, amidst which Bork gat him down from the Speech-Hill, his\nweapons clattering about him, and mingled with the men of his kindred.\n\nThen came forth a man of the kin of the Shieldings of the Upper-mark, and\nclomb the mound; and he spake in rhyme from beginning to end; for he was\na minstrel of renown:\n\n   \"Lo I am a man of the Shieldings and Geirmund is my name;\n   A half-moon back from the wild-wood out into the hills I came,\n   And I went alone in my war-gear; for we have affinity\n   With the Hundings of the Fell-folk, and with them I fain would be;\n   For I loved a maid of their kindred.  Now their dwelling was not far\n   From the outermost bounds of the Fell-folk, and bold in the battle\n   they are,\n   And have met a many people, and held their own abode.\n   Gay then was the heart within me, as over the hills I rode\n   And thought of the mirth of to-morrow and the sweet-mouthed Hunding\n   maid\n   And their old men wise and merry and their young men unafraid,\n   And the hall-glee of the Hundings and the healths o'er the guesting\n   cup.\n   But as I rode the valley, I saw a smoke go up\n   O'er the crest of the last of the grass-hills 'twixt me and the\n   Hunding roof,\n   And that smoke was black and heavy: so a while I bided aloof,\n   And drew my girths the tighter, and looked to the arms I bore\n   And handled my spear for the casting; for my heart misgave me sore,\n   For nought was that pillar of smoke like the guest-fain cooking-fire.\n   I lingered in thought for a minute, then turned me to ride up higher,\n   And as a man most wary up over the bent I rode,\n   And nigh hid peered o'er the hill-crest adown on the Hunding abode;\n   And forsooth 'twas the fire wavering all o'er the roof of old,\n   And all in the garth and about it lay the bodies of the bold;\n   And bound to a rope amidmost were the women fair and young,\n   And youths and little children, like the fish on a withy strung\n   As they lie on the grass for the angler before the beginning of night.\n   Then the rush of the wrath within me for a while nigh blinded my\n   sight;\n   Yet about the cowering war-thralls, short dark-faced men I saw,\n   Men clad in iron armour, this way and that way draw,\n   As warriors after the battle are ever wont to do.\n   Then I knew them for the foemen and their deeds to be I knew,\n   And I gathered the reins together to ride down the hill amain,\n   To die with a good stroke stricken and slay ere I was slain.\n   When lo, on the bent before me rose the head of a brown-faced man,\n   Well helmed and iron-shielded, who some Welsh speech began\n   And a short sword brandished against me; then my sight cleared and I\n   saw\n   Five others armed in likewise up hill and toward me draw,\n   And I shook the spear and sped it and clattering on his shield\n   He fell and rolled o'er smitten toward the garth and the Fell-folk's\n   field.\n\n   \"But my heart changed with his falling and the speeding of my stroke,\n   And I turned my horse; for within me the love of life awoke,\n   And I spurred, nor heeded the hill-side, but o'er rough and smooth I\n   rode\n   Till I heard no chase behind me; then I drew rein and abode.\n   And down in a dell was I gotten with a thorn-brake in its throat,\n   And heard but the plover's whistle and the blackbird's broken note\n   'Mid the thorns; when lo! from a thorn-twig away the blackbird swept,\n   And out from the brake and towards me a naked man there crept,\n   And straight I rode up towards him, and knew his face for one\n   I had seen in the hall of the Hundings ere its happy days were done.\n   I asked him his tale, but he bade me forthright to bear him away;\n   So I took him up behind me, and we rode till late in the day,\n   Toward the cover of the wild-wood, and as swiftly as we might.\n   But when yet aloof was the thicket and it now was moonless night,\n   We stayed perforce for a little, and he told me all the tale:\n   How the aliens came against them, and they fought without avail\n   Till the Roof o'er their heads was burning and they burst forth on the\n   foe,\n   And were hewn down there together; nor yet was the slaughter slow.\n   But some they saved for thralldom, yea, e'en of the fighting men,\n   Or to quell them with pains; so they stripped them; and this man\n   espying just then\n   Some chance, I mind not whatwise, from the garth fled out and away.\n\n   \"Now many a thing noteworthy of these aliens did he say,\n   But this I bid you hearken, lest I wear the time for nought,\n   That still upon the Markmen and the Mark they set their thought;\n   For they questioned this man and others through a go-between in words\n   Of us, and our lands and our chattels, and the number of our swords;\n   Of the way and the wild-wood passes and the winter and his ways.\n   Now look to see them shortly; for worn are fifteen days\n   Since in the garth of the Hundings I saw them dight for war,\n   And a hardy folk and ready and a swift-foot host they are.\"\n\nTherewith Geirmund went down clattering from the Hill and stood with his\ncompany.  But a man came forth from the other side of the ring, and clomb\nthe Hill: he was a red-haired man, rather big, clad in a skin coat, and\nbearing a bow in his hand and a quiver of arrows at his back, and a\nlittle axe hung by his side.  He said:\n\n\"I dwell in the House of the Hrossings of the Mid-mark, and I am now made\na man of the kindred: howbeit I was not born into it; for I am the son of\na fair and mighty woman of a folk of the Kymry, who was taken in war\nwhile she went big with me; I am called Fox the Red.\n\n\"These Romans have I seen, and have not died: so hearken! for my tale\nshall be short for what there is in it.\n\n\"I am, as many know, a hunter of Mirkwood, and I know all its ways and\nthe passes through the thicket somewhat better than most.\n\n\"A moon ago I fared afoot from Mid-mark through Upper-mark into the\nthicket of the south, and through it into the heath country; and I went\nover a neck and came in the early dawn into a little dale when somewhat\nof mist still hung over it.  At the dale's end I saw a man lying asleep\non the grass under a quicken tree, and his shield and sword hanging over\nhis head to a bough thereof, and his horse feeding hoppled higher up the\ndale.\n\n\"I crept up softly to him with a shaft nocked on the string, but when I\ndrew near I saw him to be of the sons of the Goths.  So I doubted\nnothing, but laid down my bow, and stood upright, and went to him and\nroused him, and he leapt up, and was wroth.\n\n\"I said to him, 'Wilt thou be wroth with a brother of the kindred meeting\nhim in unpeopled parts?'\n\n\"But he reached out for his weapons; but ere he could handle them I ran\nin on him so that he gat not his sword, and had scant time to smite at me\nwith a knife which he drew from his waist.\n\n\"I gave way before him for he was a very big man, and he rushed past me,\nand I dealt him a blow on the side of the head with my little axe which\nis called the War-babe, and gave him a great wound: and he fell on the\ngrass, and as it happened that was his bane.\n\n\"I was sorry that I had slain him, since he was a man of the Goths:\nalbeit otherwise he had slain me, for he was very wroth and dazed with\nslumber.\n\n\"He died not for a while; and he bade me fetch him water; and there was a\nwell hard by on the other side of the tree; so I fetched it him in a\ngreat shell that I carry, and he drank.  I would have sung the\nblood-staunching song over him, for I know it well.  But he said, 'It\navaileth nought: I have enough: what man art thou?'\n\n\"I said, 'I am a fosterling of the Hrossings, and my mother was taken in\nwar: my name is Fox.'\n\n\"Said he; 'O Fox, I have my due at thy hands, for I am a Markman of the\nElkings, but a guest of the Burgundians beyond the Great River; and the\nRomans are their masters and they do their bidding: even so did I who was\nbut their guest: and I a Markman to fight against the Markmen, and all\nfor fear and for gold!  And thou an alien-born hast slain their traitor\nand their dastard!  This is my due.  Give me to drink again.'\n\n\"So did I; and he said; 'Wilt thou do an errand for me to thine own\nhouse?'  'Yea,' said I.\n\n\"Said he, 'I am a messenger to the garth of the Romans, that I may tell\nthe road to the Mark, and lead them through the thicket; and other guides\nare coming after me: but not yet for three days or four.  So till they\ncome there will be no man in the Roman garth to know thee that thou art\nnot even I myself.  If thou art doughty, strip me when I am dead and do\nmy raiment on thee, and take this ring from my neck, for that is my\ntoken, and when they ask thee for a word say, \"_No limit_\"; for that is\nthe token-word.  Go south-east over the dales keeping Broadshield-fell\nsquare with thy right hand, and let thy wisdom, O Fox, lead thee to the\nGarth of the Romans, and so back to thy kindred with all tidings thou\nhast gathered--for indeed they come--a many of them.  Give me to drink.'\n\n\"So he drank again, and said, 'The bearer of this token is called\nHrosstyr of the River Goths.  He hath that name among dastards.  Thou\nshalt lay a turf upon my head.  Let my death pay for my life.'\n\n\"Therewith he fell back and died.  So I did as he bade me and took his\ngear, worth six kine, and did it on me; I laid turf upon him in that\ndale, and hid my bow and my gear in a blackthorn brake hard by, and then\ntook his horse and rode away.\n\n\"Day and night I rode till I came to the garth of the Romans; there I\ngave myself up to their watchers, and they brought me to their Duke, a\ngrim man and hard.  He said in a terrible voice, 'Thy name?'  I said,\n'Hrosstyr of the River Goths.'  He said, 'What limit?'  I answered, '_No\nlimit_.'  'The token!' said he, and held out his hand.  I gave him the\nring.  'Thou art the man,' said he.\n\n\"I thought in my heart, 'thou liest, lord,' and my heart danced for joy.\n\n\"Then he fell to asking me questions a many, and I answered every one\nglibly enough, and told him what I would, but no word of truth save for\nhis hurt, and my soul laughed within me at my lies; thought I, the\nothers, the traitors, shall come, and they shall tell him the truth, and\nhe will not trow it, or at the worst he will doubt them.  But me he\ndoubted nothing, else had he called in the tormentors to have the truth\nof me by pains; as I well saw afterwards, when they questioned with\ntorments a man and a woman of the hill-folk whom they had brought in\ncaptive.\n\n\"I went from him and went all about that garth espying everything,\nfearing nothing; albeit there were divers woful captives of the Goths,\nwho cursed me for a dastard, when they saw by my attire that I was of\ntheir blood.\n\n\"I abode there three days, and learned all that I might of the garth and\nthe host of them, and the fourth day in the morning I went out as if to\nhunt, and none hindered me, for they doubted me not.\n\n\"So I came my ways home to the Upper-mark, and was guested with the\nGeirings.  Will ye that I tell you somewhat of the ways of these Romans\nof the garth?  The time presses, and my tale runneth longer than I would.\nWhat will ye?\"\n\nThen there arose a murmur, \"Tell all, tell all.\"  \"Nay,\" said the Fox,\n\"All I may not tell; so much did I behold there during the three days'\nstay; but this much it behoveth you to know: that these men have no other\nthought save to win the Mark and waste it, and slay the fighting men and\nthe old carles, and enthrall such as they will, that is, all that be fair\nand young, and they long sorely for our women either to have or to sell.\n\n\"As for their garth, it is strongly walled about with a dyke newly dug;\non the top thereof are they building a wall made of clay, and burned like\npots into ashlar stones hard and red, and these are laid in lime.\n\n\"It is now the toil of the thralls of our blood whom they have taken,\nboth men and women, to dig that clay and to work it, and bear it to\nkilns, and to have for reward scant meat and many stripes.  For it is a\ngrim folk, that laugheth to see others weep.\n\n\"Their men-at-arms are well dight and for the most part in one way: they\nare helmed with iron, and have iron on their breasts and reins, and bear\nlong shields that cover them to the knees.  They are girt with a sax and\nhave a heavy casting-spear.  They are dark-skinned and ugly of aspect,\nsurly and of few words: they drink little, and eat not much.\n\n\"They have captains of tens and of hundreds over them, and that war-duke\nover all; he goeth to and fro with gold on his head and his breast, and\ncommonly hath a cloak cast over him of the colour of the crane's-bill\nblossom.\n\n\"They have an altar in the midst of their burg, and thereon they\nsacrifice to their God, who is none other than their banner of war, which\nis an image of the ravening eagle with outspread wings; but yet another\nGod they have, and look you! it is a wolf, as if they were of the kin of\nour brethren; a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs; wonderful is\nthis.\n\n\"I tell you that they are grim; and know it by this token: those captains\nof tens, and of hundreds, spare not to smite the warriors with staves\neven before all men, when all goeth not as they would; and yet, though\nthey be free men, and mighty warriors, they endure it and smite not in\nturn.  They are a most evil folk.\n\n\"As to their numbers, they of the burg are hard on three thousand footmen\nof the best; and of horsemen five hundred, nowise good; and of bowmen and\nslingers six hundred or more: their bows weak; their slingers cunning\nbeyond measure.  And the talk is that when they come upon us they shall\nhave with them some five hundred warriors of the Over River Goths, and\nothers of their own folk.\"\n\nThen he said:\n\n   \"O men of the Mark, will ye meet them in the meadows and the field,\n   Or will ye flee before them and have the wood for a shield?\n   Or will ye wend to their war-burg with weapons cast away,\n   With your women and your children, a peace of them to pray?\n   So doing, not all shall perish; but most shall long to die\n   Ere in the garths of the Southland two moons have loitered by.\"\n\nThen rose the rumour loud and angry mingled with the rattle of swords and\nthe clash of spears on shields; but Fox said:\n\n\"Needs must ye follow one of these three ways.  Nay, what say I? there\nare but two ways and not three; for if ye flee they shall follow you to\nthe confines of the earth.  Either these Welsh shall take all, and our\nlives to boot, or we shall hold to all that is ours, and live merrily.\nThe sword doometh; and in three days it may be the courts shall be\nhallowed: small is the space between us.\"\n\nTherewith he also got him down from the Hill, and joined his own house:\nand men said that he had spoken well and wisely.  But there arose a noise\nof men talking together on these tidings; and amidst it an old warrior of\nthe Nether-mark strode forth and up to the Hill-top.  Gaunt and stark he\nwas to look on; and all men knew him and he was well-beloved, so all held\ntheir peace as he said:\n\n\"I am Otter of the Laxings: now needeth but few words till the War-duke\nis chosen, and we get ready to wend our ways in arms.  Here have ye heard\nthree good men and true tell of our foes, and this last, Fox the Red,\nhath seen them and hath more to tell when we are on the way; nor is the\nway hard to find.  It were scarce well to fall upon these men in their\ngarth and war-burg; for hard is a wall to slay.  Better it were to meet\nthem in the Wild-wood, which may well be a friend to us and a wall, but\nto them a net.  O Agni of the Daylings, thou warder of the Thing-stead,\nbid men choose a War-duke if none gainsay it.\"\n\nAnd without more words he clattered down the Hill, and went and stood\nwith the Laxing band.  But the old Dayling arose and blew the horn, and\nthere was at once a great silence, amidst which he said:\n\n\"Children of Slains-father, doth the Folk go to the war?\"\n\nThere was no voice but shouted \"yea,\" and the white swords sprang aloft,\nand the westering sun swept along a half of them as they tossed to and\nfro, and the others showed dead-white and fireless against the dark wood.\n\nThen again spake Agni:\n\n\"Will ye choose the War-duke now and once, or shall it be in a while,\nafter others have spoken?\"\n\nAnd the voice of the Folk went up, \"Choose!  Choose!\"\n\nSaid Agni: \"Sayeth any aught against it?\"  But no voice of a gainsayer\nwas heard, and Agni said:\n\n\"Children of Tyr, what man will ye have for a leader and a duke of war?\"\n\nThen a great shout sprang up from amidst the swords: \"We will have\nThiodolf; Thiodolf the Wolfing!\"\n\nSaid Agni: \"I hear no other name; are ye of one mind? hath any aught to\nsay against it?  If that be so, let him speak now, and not forbear to\nfollow in the wheatfield of the spears.  Speak, ye that will not follow\nThiodolf!\"\n\nNo voice gainsaid him: then said the Dayling: \"Come forth thou War-duke\nof the Markmen! take up the gold ring from the horns of the altar, set it\non thine arm and come up hither!\"\n\nThen came forth Thiodolf into the sun, and took up the gold ring from\nwhere it lay, and did it on his arm.  And this was the ring of the leader\nof the folk whenso one should be chosen: it was ancient and daintily\nwrought, but not very heavy: so ancient it was that men said it had been\nwrought by the dwarfs.\n\nSo Thiodolf went up on to the hill, and all men cried out on him for joy,\nfor they knew his wisdom in war.  Many wondered to see him unhelmed, but\nthey had a deeming that he must have made oath to the Gods thereof and\ntheir hearts were glad of it.  They took note of the dwarf-wrought\nhauberk, and even from a good way off they could see what a treasure of\nsmith's work it was, and they deemed it like enough that spells had been\nsung over it to make it sure against point and edge: for they knew that\nThiodolf was well beloved of the Gods.\n\nBut when Thiodolf was on the Hill of Speech, he said:\n\n\"Men of the kindreds, I am your War-duke to-day; but it is oftenest the\ncustom when ye go to war to choose you two dukes, and I would it were so\nnow.  No child's play is the work that lies before us; and if one leader\nchance to fall let there be another to take his place without stop or\nstay.  Thou Agni of the Daylings, bid the Folk choose them another duke\nif so they will.\"\n\nSaid Agni: \"Good is this which our War-duke hath spoken; say then, men of\nthe Mark, who shall stand with Thiodolf to lead you against the aliens?\"\n\nThen was there a noise and a crying of names, and more than two names\nseemed to be cried out; but by far the greater part named either Otter of\nthe Laxings, or Heriulf of the Wolfings.  True it is that Otter was a\nvery wise warrior, and well known to all the men of the Mark; yet so dear\nwas Heriulf to them, that none would have named Otter had it not been\nmostly their custom not to choose both War-dukes from one House.\n\nNow spake Agni: \"Children of Tyr, I hear you name more than one name: now\nlet each man cry out clearly the name he nameth.\"\n\nSo the Folk cried the names once more, but this time it was clear that\nnone was named save Otter and Heriulf; so the Dayling was at point to\nspeak again, but or ever a word left his lips, Heriulf the mighty, the\nancient of days, stood forth: and when men saw that he would take up the\nword there was a great silence.  So he spake:\n\n\"Hearken, children!  I am old and war-wise; but my wisdom is the wisdom\nof the sword of the mighty warrior, that knoweth which way it should\nwend, and hath no thought of turning back till it lieth broken in the\nfield.  Such wisdom is good against Folks that we have met heretofore; as\nwhen we have fought with the Huns, who would sweep us away from the face\nof the earth, or with the Franks or the Burgundians, who would quell us\ninto being something worser than they be.  But here is a new foe, and new\nwisdom, and that right shifty, do we need to meet them.  One wise duke\nhave ye gotten, Thiodolf to wit; and he is young beside me and beside\nOtter of the Laxings.  And now if ye must needs have an older man to\nstand beside him, (and that is not ill) take ye Otter; for old though his\nbody be, the thought within him is keen and supple like the best of Welsh-\nwrought blades, and it liveth in the days that now are: whereas for me,\nmeseemeth, my thoughts are in the days bygone.  Yet look to it, that I\nshall not fail to lead as the sword of the valiant leadeth, or the shaft\nshot by the cunning archer.  Choose ye Otter; I have spoken over long.\"\n\nThen spoke Agni the Dayling, and laughed withal: \"One man of the Folk\nhath spoken for Otter and against Heriulf--now let others speak if they\nwill!\"\n\nSo the cry came forth, \"Otter let it be, we will have Otter!\"\n\n\"Speaketh any against Otter?\" said Agni.  But there was no voice raised\nagainst him.\n\nThen Agni said: \"Come forth, Otter of the Laxings, and hold the ring with\nThiodolf.\"\n\nThen Otter went up on to the hill and stood by Thiodolf, and they held\nthe ring together; and then each thrust his hand and arm through the ring\nand clasped hands together, and stood thus awhile, and all the Folk\nshouted together.\n\nThen spake Agni: \"Now shall we hew the horses and give the gifts to the\nGods.\"\n\nTherewith he and the two War-dukes came down from the hill; and stood\nbefore the altar; and the nine warriors of the Daylings stood forth with\naxes to hew the horses and with copper bowls wherein to catch the blood\nof them, and each hewed down his horse to the Gods, but the two War-dukes\nslew the tenth and fairest: and the blood was caught in the bowls, and\nAgni took a sprinkler and went round about the ring of men, and cast the\nblood of the Gods'-gifts over the Folk, as was the custom of those days.\n\nThen they cut up the carcases and burned on the altar the share of the\nGods, and Agni and the War-dukes tasted thereof, and the rest they bore\noff to the Daylings' abode for the feast to be holden that night.\n\nThen Otter and Thiodolf spake apart together for awhile, and presently\nwent up again on to the Speech-Hill, and Thiodolf said:\n\n   \"O kindreds of the Markmen; to-morrow with the day\n   We shall wend up Mirkwood-water to bar our foes the way;\n   And there shall we make our wain-burg on the edges of the wood,\n   Where in the days past over at last the aliens stood,\n   The Slaughter Tofts ye call it.  There tidings shall we get\n   If the curse of the world is awakened, and the serpent crawleth yet\n   Amidst the Mirkwood thicket; and when the sooth we know,\n   Then bearing battle with us through the thicket shall we go,\n   The ancient Wood-wolf's children, and the People of the Shield,\n   And the Spear-kin and the Horse-kin, while the others keep the field\n   About the warded wain-burg; for not many need we there\n   Where amidst of the thickets' tangle and the woodland net they fare,\n   And the hearts of the aliens falter and they curse the fight ne'er\n   done,\n   And wonder who is fighting and which way is the sun.\"\n\nThus he spoke; then Agni took up the war-horn again, and blew a blast,\nand then he cried out:\n\n   \"Now sunder we the Folk-mote! and the feast is for to-night,\n   And to-morrow the Wayfaring; But unnamed is the day of the fight;\n   O warriors, look ye to it that not long we need abide\n   'Twixt the hour of the word we have spoken, and our fair-fame's\n   blooming tide!\n   For then 'midst the toil and the turmoil shall we sow the seeds of\n   peace,\n   And the Kindreds' long endurance, and the Goth-folk's great increase.\"\n\nThen arose the last great shout, and soberly and in due order, kindred by\nkindred, they turned and departed from the Thing-stead and went their way\nthrough the wood to the abode of the Daylings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE ANCIENT MAN OF THE DAYLINGS\n\n\nThere still hung the more part of the stay-at-homes round about the Roof.\nBut on the plain beneath the tofts were all the wains of the host drawn\nup round about a square like the streets about a market-place; all these\nnow had their tilts rigged over them, some white, some black, some red,\nsome tawny of hue; and some, which were of the Beamings, green like the\nleafy tree.\n\nThe warriors of the host went down into this wain-town, which they had\nnot fenced in any way, since they in no wise looked for any onset there;\nand there were their thralls dighting the feast for them, and a many of\nthe Dayling kindred, both men and women, went with them; but some men did\nthe Daylings bring into their Roof, for there was room for a good many\nbesides their own folk.  So they went over the Bridge of turf into the\ngarth and into the Great Roof of the Daylings; and amongst these were the\ntwo War-dukes.\n\nSo when they came to the dais it was as fair all round about there as\nmight well be; and there sat elders and ancient warriors to welcome the\nguests; and among them was the old carle who had sat on the edge of the\nburg to watch the faring of the host, and had shuddered back at the sight\nof the Wolfing Banner.\n\nAnd when the old carle saw the guests, he fixed his eyes on Thiodolf, and\npresently came up and stood before him; and Thiodolf looked on the old\nman, and greeted him kindly and smiled on him; but the carle spake not\ntill he had looked on him a while; and at last he fell a-trembling, and\nreached his hands out to Thiodolf's bare head, and handled his curls and\ncaressed them, as a mother does with her son, even if he be a grizzled-\nhaired man, when there is none by: and at last he said:\n\n   \"How dear is the head of the mighty, and the apple of the tree\n   That blooms with the life of the people which is and yet shall be!\n   It is helmed with ancient wisdom, and the long remembered thought,\n   That liveth when dead is the iron, and its very rust but nought.\n   Ah! were I but young as aforetime, I would fare to the battle-stead\n   And stand amidst of the spear-hail for the praise of the hand and the\n   head!\"\n\nThen his hands left Thiodolf's head, and strayed down to his shoulders\nand his breast, and he felt the cold rings of the hauberk, and let his\nhands fall down to his side again; and the tears gushed out of his old\neyes and again he spake:\n\n   \"O house of the heart of the mighty, O breast of the battle-lord\n   Why art thou coldly hidden from the flickering flame of the sword?\n   I know thee not, nor see thee; thou art as the fells afar\n   Where the Fathers have their dwelling, and the halls of Godhome are:\n   The wind blows wild betwixt us, and the cloud-rack flies along,\n   And high aloft enfoldeth the dwelling of the strong;\n   They are, as of old they have been, but their hearths flame not for\n   me;\n   And the kindness of their feast-halls mine eyes shall never see.\"\n\nThiodolf's lips still smiled on the old man, but a shadow had come over\nhis eyes and his brow; and the chief of the Daylings and their mighty\nguests stood by listening intently with the knit brows of anxious men;\nnor did any speak till the ancient man again betook him to words:\n\n   \"I came to the house of the foeman when hunger made me a fool;\n   And the foeman said, 'Thou art weary, lo, set thy foot on the stool;'\n   And I stretched out my feet,--and was shackled: and he spake with a\n   dastard's smile,\n   'O guest, thine hands are heavy; now rest them for a while!'\n   So I stretched out my hands, and the hand-gyves lay cold on either\n   wrist:\n   And the wood of the wolf had been better than that feast-hall, had I\n   wist\n   That this was the ancient pit-fall, and the long expected trap,\n   And that now for my heart's desire I had sold the world's goodhap.\"\n\nTherewith the ancient man turned slowly away from Thiodolf, and departed\nsadly to his own place.  Thiodolf changed countenance but little, albeit\nthose about him looked strangely on him, as though if they durst they\nwould ask him what these words might be, and if he from his hidden\nknowledge might fit a meaning to them.  For to many there was a word of\nwarning in them, and to some an evil omen of the days soon to be; and\nscarce anyone heard those words but he had a misgiving in his heart, for\nthe ancient man was known to be foreseeing, and wild and strange his\nwords seemed to them.\n\nBut Agni would make light of it, and he said: \"Asmund the Old is of good\nwill, and wise he is; but he hath great longings for the deeds of men,\nwhen he hath tidings of battle; for a great warrior and a red-hand hewer\nhe hath been in times past; he loves the Kindred, and deems it ill if he\nmay not fare afield with them; for the thought of dying in the straw is\nhateful to him.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said another, \"and moreover he hath seen sons whom he loved slain\nin battle; and when he seeth a warrior in his prime he becometh dear to\nhim, and he feareth for him.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" said a third, \"Asmund is foreseeing; and may be, Thiodolf, thou\nwilt wot of the drift of these words, and tell us thereof.\"\n\nBut Thiodolf spake nought of the matter, though in his heart he pondered\nit.\n\nSo the guests were led to table, and the feast began, within the hall and\nwithout it, and wide about the plain; and the Dayling maidens went in\nbands trimly decked out throughout all the host and served the warriors\nwith meat and drink, and sang the overword to their lays, and smote the\nharp, and drew the bow over the fiddle till it laughed and wailed and\nchuckled, and were blithe and merry with all, and great was the glee on\nthe eve of battle.  And if Thiodolf's heart were overcast, his face\nshowed it not, but he passed from hall to wain-burg and from wain-burg to\nhall again blithe and joyous with all men.  And thereby he raised the\nhearts of men, and they deemed it good that they had gotten such a War-\nduke, meet to uphold all hearts of men both at the feast and in the fray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THAT CARLINE COMETH TO THE ROOF OF THE WOLFINGS\n\n\nNow it was three days after this that the women were gathering to the\nWomen's-Chamber of the Roof of the Wolfings a little before the afternoon\nchanges into evening.  The hearts of most were somewhat heavy, for the\ndoubt wherewith they had watched the departure of the fighting-men still\nhung about them; nor had they any tidings from the host (nor was it like\nthat they should have).  And as they were somewhat down-hearted, so it\nseemed by the aspect of all things that afternoon.  It was not yet the\nevening, as is aforesaid, but the day was worn and worsened, and all\nthings looked weary.  The sky was a little clouded, but not much; yet was\nit murky down in the south-east, and there was a threat of storm in it,\nand in the air close round each man's head, and in the very waving of the\nleafy boughs.  There was by this time little doing in field and fold (for\nthe kine were milked), and the women were coming up from the acres and\nthe meadow and over the open ground anigh the Roof; there was the grass\nworn and dusty, and the women that trod it, their feet were tanned and\nworn, and dusty also; skin-dry and weary they looked, with the sweat\ndried upon them; their girt-up gowns grey and lightless, their\nhalf-unbound hair blowing about them in the dry wind, which had in it no\nmorning freshness, and no evening coolness.\n\nIt was a time when toil was well-nigh done, but had left its aching\nbehind it; a time for folk to sleep and forget for a little while, till\nthe low sun should make it evening, and make all things fair with his\nlevel rays; no time for anxious thoughts concerning deeds doing, wherein\nthe anxious ones could do nought to help.  Yet such thoughts those stay-\nat-homes needs must have in the hour of their toil scarce over, their\nrest and mirth not begun.\n\nSlowly one by one the women went in by the Women's-door, and the Hall-Sun\nsat on a stone hard by, and watched them as they passed; and she looked\nkeenly at all persons and all things.  She had been working in the acres,\nand her hand was yet on the hoe she had been using, and but for her face\nher body was as of one resting after toil: her dark blue gown was\nungirded, her dark hair loose and floating, the flowers that had wreathed\nit, now faded, lying strewn upon the grass before her: her feet bare for\ncoolness' sake, her left hand lying loose and open upon her knee.\n\nYet though her body otherwise looked thus listless, in her face was no\nlistlessness, nor rest: her eyes were alert and clear, shining like two\nstars in the heavens of dawn-tide; her lips were set close, her brow\nknit, as of one striving to shape thoughts hard to understand into words\nthat all might understand.\n\nSo she sat noting all things, as woman by woman went past her into the\nhall, till at last she slowly rose to her feet; for there came two young\nwomen leading between them that same old carline with whom she had talked\non the Hill-of-Speech.  She looked on the carline steadfastly, but gave\nno token of knowing her; but the ancient woman spoke when she came near\nto the Hall-Sun, and old as her semblance was, yet did her speech sound\nsweet to the Hall-Sun, and indeed to all those that heard it and she\nsaid:\n\n\"May we be here to-night, O Hall-Sun, thou lovely Seeress of the mighty\nWolfings? may a wandering woman sit amongst you and eat the meat of the\nWolfings?\"\n\nThen spake the Hall-Sun in a sweet measured voice: \"Surely mother: all\nmen who bring peace with them are welcome guests to the Wolfings: nor\nwill any ask thine errand, but we will let thy tidings flow from thee as\nthou wilt.  This is the custom of the kindred, and no word of mine own; I\nspeak to thee because thou hast spoken to me, but I have no authority\nhere, being myself but an alien.  Albeit I serve the House of the\nWolfings, and I love it as the hound loveth his master who feedeth him,\nand his master's children who play with him.  Enter, mother, and be glad\nof heart, and put away care from thee.\"\n\nThen the old woman drew nigher to her and sat down in the dust at her\nfeet, for she was now sitting down again, and took her hand and kissed it\nand fondled it, and seemed loth to leave handling the beauty of the Hall-\nSun; but she looked kindly on the carline, and smiled on her, and leaned\ndown to her, and kissed her mouth, and said:\n\n\"Damsels, take care of this poor woman, and make her good cheer; for she\nis wise of wit, and a friend of the Wolfings; and I have seen her before,\nand spoken with her; and she loveth us.  But as for me I must needs be\nalone in the meads for a while; and it may be that when I come to you\nagain, I shall have a word to tell you.\"\n\nNow indeed it was in a manner true that the Hall-Sun had no authority in\nthe Wolfing House; yet was she so well beloved for her wisdom and beauty\nand her sweet speech, that all hastened to do her will in small matters\nand in great, and now as they looked at her after the old woman had\ncaressed her, it seemed to them that her fairness grew under their eyes,\nand that they had never seen her so fair; and the sight of her seemed so\ngood to them, that the outworn day and its weariness changed to them, and\nit grew as pleasant as the first hours of the sunlight, when men arise\nhappy from their rest, and look on the day that lieth hopeful before them\nwith all its deeds to be.\n\nSo they grew merry, and they led the carline into the Hall with them, and\nset her down in the Women's-Chamber, and washed her feet, and gave her\nmeat and drink, and bade her rest and think of nothing troublous, and in\nall wise made her good cheer; and she was merry with them, and praised\ntheir fairness and their deftness, and asked them many questions about\ntheir weaving and spinning and carding; (howbeit the looms were idle as\nthen because it was midsummer, and the men gone to the war).  And this\nthey deemed strange, as it seemed to them that all women should know of\nsuch things; but they thought it was a token that she came from far away.\n\nBut afterwards she sat among them, and told them pleasant tales of past\ntimes and far countries, and was blithe to them and they to her and the\ntime wore on toward nightfall in the Women's-Chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--THE HALL-SUN SPEAKETH\n\n\nBut for the Hall-Sun; she sat long on that stone by the Women's-door; but\nwhen the evening was now come, she arose and went down through the\ncornfields and into the meadow, and wandered away as her feet took her.\n\nNight was falling by then she reached that pool of Mirkwood-water, whose\neddies she knew so well.  There she let the water cover her in the deep\nstream, and she floated down and sported with the ripples where the river\nleft that deep to race over the shallows; and the moon was casting\nshadows by then she came up the bank again by the shallow end bearing in\nher arms a bundle of the blue-flowering mouse-ear.  Then she clad herself\nat once, and went straight as one with a set purpose toward the Great\nRoof, and entered by the Man's-door; and there were few men within and\nthey but old and heavy with the burden of years and the coming of night-\ntide; but they wondered and looked to each other and nodded their heads\nas she passed them by, as men who would say, There is something toward.\n\nSo she went to her sleeping-place, and did on fresh raiment, and came\nforth presently clad in white and shod with gold and having her hair\nwreathed about with the herb of wonder, the blue-flowering mouse-ear of\nMirkwood-water.  Thus she passed through the Hall, and those elders were\nstirred in their hearts when they beheld her beauty.  But she opened the\ndoor of the Women's-Chamber, and stood on the threshold; and lo, there\nsat the carline amidst a ring of the Wolfing women, and she telling them\ntales of old time such as they had not yet heard; and her eyes were\nglittering, and the sweet words were flowing from her mouth; but she sat\nstraight up like a young woman; and at whiles it seemed to those who\nhearkened, that she was no old and outworn woman, but fair and strong,\nand of much avail.  But when she heard the Hall-Sun she turned and saw\nher on the threshold, and her speech fell suddenly, and all that might\nand briskness faded from her, and she fixed her eyes on the Hall-Sun and\nlooked wistfully and anxiously on her.\n\nThen spake the Hall-Sun standing in the doorway:\n\n   \"Hear ye a matter, maidens, and ye Wolfing women all,\n   And thou alien guest of the Wolfings!  But come ye up the hall,\n   That the ancient men may hearken: for methinks I have a word\n   Of the battle of the Kindreds, and the harvest of the sword.\"\n\nThen all arose up with great joy, for they knew that the tidings were\ngood, when they looked on the face of the Hall-Sun and beheld the pride\nof her beauty unmarred by doubt or pain.\n\nShe led them forth to the dais, and there were the sick and the elders\ngathered and some ancient men of the thralls: so she stepped lightly up\nto her place, and stood under her namesake, the wondrous lamp of ancient\ndays.  And thus she spake:\n\n   \"On my soul there lies no burden, and no tangle of the fight\n   In plain or dale or wild-wood enmeshes now my sight.\n   I see the Markmen's wain-burg, and I see their warriors go\n   As men who wait for battle and the coming of the foe.\n   And they pass 'twixt the wood and the wain-burg within earshot of the\n   horn,\n   But over the windy meadows no sound thereof is borne,\n   And all is well amongst them.  To the burg I draw anigh\n   And I see all battle-banners in the breeze of morning fly,\n   But no Wolfings round their banner and no warrior of the Shield,\n   No Geiring and no Hrossing in the burg or on the field.\"\n\nShe held her peace for a little while, and no one dared to speak; then\nshe lifted up her head and spake:\n\n   \"Now I go by the lip of the wild-wood and a sound withal I hear,\n   As of men in the paths of the thicket, and a many drawing anear.\n   Then, muffled yet by the tree-boles, I hear the Shielding song,\n   And warriors blithe and merry with the battle of the strong.\n   Give back a little, Markmen, make way for men to pass\n   To your ordered battle-dwelling o'er the trodden meadow-grass,\n   For alive with men is the wild-wood and shineth with the steel,\n   And hath a voice most merry to tell of the Kindreds' weal,\n   'Twixt each tree a warrior standeth come back from the spear-strewn\n   way,\n   And forth they come from the wild-wood and a little band are they.\"\n\nThen again was she silent; but her head sank not, as of one thinking, as\nbefore it did, but she looked straight forward with bright eyes and\nsmiling, as she said:\n\n   \"Lo, now the guests they are bringing that ye have not seen before;\n   Yet guests but ill-entreated; for they lack their shields of war,\n   No spear in the hand they carry and with no sax are girt.\n   Lo, these are the dreaded foemen, these once so strong to hurt;\n   The men that all folk fled from, the swift to drive the spoil,\n   The men that fashioned nothing but the trap to make men toil.\n   They drew the sword in the cities, they came and struck the stroke\n   And smote the shield of the Markmen, and point and edge they broke.\n   They drew the sword in the war-garth, they swore to bring aback\n   God's gifts from the Markmen houses where the tables never lack.\n   O Markmen, take the God-gifts that came on their own feet\n   O'er the hills through the Mirkwood thicket the Stone of Tyr to meet!\"\n\nAgain she stayed her song, which had been loud and joyous, and they who\nheard her knew that the Kindreds had gained the day, and whilst the Hall-\nSun was silent they fell to talking of this fair day of battle and the\ntaking of captives.  But presently she spread out her hands again and\nthey held their peace, and she said:\n\n   \"I see, O Wolfing women, and many a thing I see,\n   But not all things, O elders, this eve shall ye learn of me,\n   For another mouth there cometh: the thicket I behold\n   And the Sons of Tyr amidst it, and I see the oak-trees old,\n   And the war-shout ringing round them; and I see the battle-lord\n   Unhelmed amidst of the mighty; and I see his leaping sword;\n   Strokes struck and warriors falling, and the streaks of spears I see,\n   But hereof shall the other tell you who speaketh after me.\n   For none other than the Shieldings from out the wood have come,\n   And they shift the turn with the Daylings to drive the folk-spear\n   home,\n   And to follow with the Wolfings and thrust the war-beast forth.\n   And so good men deem the tidings that they bid them journey north\n   On the feet of a Shielding runner, that Gisli hath to name;\n   And west of the water he wendeth by the way that the Wolfings came;\n   Now for sleep he tarries never, and no meat is in his mouth\n   Till the first of the Houses hearkeneth the tidings of the south;\n   Lo, he speaks, and the mead-sea sippeth, and the bread by the way doth\n   eat,\n   And over the Geiring threshold and outward pass his feet;\n   And he breasts the Burg of the Daylings and saith his happy word,\n   And stayeth to drink for a minute of the waves of Battleford.\n   Lone then by the stream he runneth, and wendeth the wild-wood road,\n   And dasheth through the hazels of the Oselings' fair abode,\n   And the Elking women know it, and their hearts are glad once more,\n   And ye--yea, hearken, Wolfings, for his feet are at the door.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--TIDINGS OF THE BATTLE IN MIRKWOOD\n\n\nAs the Hall-Sun made an end they heard in good sooth the feet of the\nrunner on the hard ground without the hall, and presently the door opened\nand he came leaping over the threshold, and up to the table, and stood\nleaning on it with one hand, his breast heaving with his last swift run.\nThen he spake presently:\n\n\"I am Gisli of the Shieldings: Otter sendeth me to the Hall-Sun; but on\nthe way I was to tell tidings to the Houses west of the Water: so have I\ndone.  Now is my journey ended; for Otter saith: 'Let the Hall-Sun note\nthe tidings and send word of them by four of the lightest limbed of the\nwomen, or by lads a-horseback, both west and east of the Water; let her\nsend the word as it seemeth to her, whether she hath seen it or not.  I\nwill drink a short draught since my running is over.\"\n\nThen a damsel brought him a horn of mead and let it come into his hand,\nand he drank sighing with pleasure, while the damsel for pleasure of him\nand his tidings laid her hand on his shoulder.  Then he set down the horn\nand spake:\n\n\"We, the Shieldings, with the Geirings, the Hrossings, and the Wolfings,\nthree hundred warriors and more, were led into the Wood by Thiodolf the\nWar-duke, beside whom went Fox, who hath seen the Romans.  We were all\nafoot; for there is no wide way through the Wood, nor would we have it\notherwise, lest the foe find the thicket easy.  But many of us know the\nthicket and its ways; so we made not the easy hard.  I was near the War-\nduke, for I know the thicket and am light-foot: I am a bowman.  I saw\nThiodolf that he was unhelmed and bore no shield, nor had he any coat of\nfence; nought but a deer-skin frock.\"\n\nAs he said that word, the carline, who had drawn very near to him and was\nlooking hard at his face, turned and looked on the Hall-Sun and stared at\nher till she reddened under those keen eyes: for in her heart began to\ngather some knowledge of the tale of her mother and what her will was.\n\nBut Gisli went on: \"Yet by his side was his mighty sword, and we all knew\nit for Throng-plough, and were glad of it and of him and the unfenced\nbreast of the dauntless.  Six hours we went spreading wide through the\nthicket, not always seeing one another, but knowing one another to be\nnigh; those that knew the thicket best led, the others followed on.  So\nwe went till it was high noon on the plain and glimmering dusk in the\nthicket, and we saw nought, save here and there a roe, and here and there\na sounder of swine, and coneys where it was opener, and the sun shone and\nthe grass grew for a little space.  So came we unto where the thicket\nended suddenly, and there was a long glade of the wild-wood, all set\nabout with great oak-trees and grass thereunder, which I knew well; and\nthereof the tale tells that it was a holy place of the folk who abided in\nthese parts before the Sons of the Goths.  Now will I drink.\"\n\nSo he drank of the horn and said: \"It seemeth that Fox had a deeming of\nthe way the Romans should come; so now we abided in the thicket without\nthat glade and lay quiet and hidden, spreading ourselves as much about\nthat lawn of the oak-trees as we might, the while Fox and three others\ncrept through the wood to espy what might be toward: not long had they\nbeen gone ere we heard a war-horn blow, and it was none of our horns: it\nwas a long way off, but we looked to our weapons: for men are eager for\nthe foe and the death that cometh, when they lie hidden in the thicket.  A\nwhile passed, and again we heard the horn, and it was nigher and had a\nmarvellous voice; then in a while was a little noise of men, not their\nvoices, but footsteps going warily through the brake to the south, and\ntwelve men came slowly and warily into that oak-lawn, and lo, one of them\nwas Fox; but he was clad in the raiment of the dastard of the Goths whom\nhe had slain.  I tell you my heart beat, for I saw that the others were\nRoman men, and one of them seemed to be a man of authority, and he held\nFox by the shoulder, and pointed to the thicket where we lay, and\nsomething he said to him, as we saw by his gesture and face, but his\nvoice we heard not, for he spake soft.\n\n\"Then of those ten men of his he sent back two, and Fox going between\nthem, as though he should be slain if he misled them; and he and the\neight abided there wisely and warily, standing silently some six feet\nfrom each other, moving scarce at all, but looking like images fashioned\nof brown copper and iron; holding their casting-spears (which be\nmarvellous heavy weapons) and girt with the sax.\n\n\"As they stood there, not out of earshot of a man speaking in his wonted\nvoice, our War-duke made a sign to those about him, and we spread very\nquietly to the right hand and the left of him once more, and we drew as\nclose as might be to the thicket's edge, and those who had bows the\nnighest thereto.  Thus then we abided a while again; and again came the\nhorn's voice; for belike they had no mind to come their ways covertly\nbecause of their pride.\n\n\"Soon therewithal comes Fox creeping back to us, and I saw him whisper\ninto the ear of the War-duke, but heard not the word he said.  I saw that\nhe had hanging to him two Roman saxes, so I deemed he had slain those\ntwo, and so escaped the Romans.  Maidens, it were well that ye gave me to\ndrink again, for I am weary and my journey is done.\"\n\nSo again they brought him the horn, and made much of him; and he drank,\nand then spake on.\n\n\"Now heard we the horn's voice again quite close, and it was sharp and\nshrill, and nothing like to the roar of our battle-horns: still was the\nwood and no wind abroad, not even down the oak-lawn; and we heard now the\ntramp of many men as they thrashed through the small wood and bracken of\nthe thicket-way; and those eight men and their leader came forward,\nmoving like one, close up to the thicket where I lay, just where the path\npassed into the thicket beset by the Sons of the Goths: so near they were\nthat I could see the dints upon their armour, and the strands of the wire\non their sax-handles.  Down then bowed the tall bracken on the further\nside of the wood-lawn, the thicket crashed before the march of men, and\non they strode into the lawn, a goodly band, wary, alert, and silent of\ncries.\n\n\"But when they came into the lawn they spread out somewhat to their left\nhands, that is to say on the west side, for that way was the clear glade;\nbut on the east the thicket came close up to them and edged them away.\nTherein lay the Goths.\n\n\"There they stayed awhile, and spread out but a little, as men marching,\nnot as men fighting.  A while we let them be; and we saw their captain,\nno big man, but dight with very fair armour and weapons; and there drew\nup to him certain Goths armed, the dastards of the folk, and another\nunarmed, an old man bound and bleeding.  With these Goths had the captain\nsome converse, and presently he cried out two or three words of Welsh in\na loud voice, and the nine men who were ahead shifted them somewhat away\nfrom us to lead down the glade westward.\n\n\"The prey had come into the net, but they had turned their faces toward\nthe mouth of it.\n\n\"Then turned Thiodolf swiftly to the man behind him who carried the war-\nhorn, and every man handled his weapons: but that man understood, and set\nthe little end to his mouth, and loud roared the horn of the Markmen, and\nneither friend nor foe misdoubted the tale thereof.  Then leaped every\nman to his feet, all bow-strings twanged and the cast-spears flew; no man\nforebore to shout; each as he might leapt out of the thicket and fell on\nwith sword and axe and spear, for it was from the bowmen but one shaft\nand no more.\n\n\"Then might you have seen Thiodolf as he bounded forward like the wild-\ncat on the hare, how he had no eyes for any save the Roman captain.\nFoemen enough he had round about him after the two first bounds from the\nthicket; for the Romans were doing their best to spread, that they might\nhandle those heavy cast-spears, though they might scarce do it, just come\nout of the thicket as they were, and thrust together by that onslaught of\nthe kindreds falling on from two sides and even somewhat from behind.  To\nright and left flashed Throng-plough, while Thiodolf himself scarce\nseemed to guide it: men fell before him at once, and close at his heels\npoured the Wolfing kindred into the gap, and in a minute of time was he\namidst of the throng and face to face with the gold-dight captain.\n\n\"What with the sweep of Throng-plough and the Wolfing onrush, there was\nspace about him for a great stroke; he gave a side-long stroke to his\nright and hewed down a tall Burgundian, and then up sprang the white\nblade, but ere its edge fell he turned his wrist, and drove the point\nthrough that Captain's throat just above the ending of his hauberk, so\nthat he fell dead amidst of his folk.\n\n\"All the four kindreds were on them now, and amidst them, and needs must\nthey give way: but stoutly they fought; for surely no other warriors\nmight have withstood that onslaught of the Markmen for the twinkling of\nan eye: but had the Romans had but the space to have spread themselves\nout there, so as to handle their shot-weapons, many a woman's son of us\nhad fallen; for no man shielded himself in his eagerness, but let the\nswiftness of the Onset of point-and-edge shield him; which, sooth to say,\nis often a good shield, as here was found.\n\n\"So those that were unslain and unhurt fled west along the glade, but not\nas dastards, and had not Thiodolf followed hard in the chase according to\nhis wont, they might even yet have made a fresh stand and spread from oak-\ntree to oak-tree across the glade: but as it befel, they might not get a\nfair offing so as to disentangle themselves and array themselves in good\norder side by side; and whereas the Markmen were fleet of foot, and in\nthe woods they knew, there were a many aliens slain in the chase or taken\nalive unhurt or little hurt: but the rest fled this way and that way into\nthe thicket, with whom were some of the Burgundians; so there they abide\nnow as outcasts and men unholy, to be slain as wild-beasts one by one as\nwe meet them.\n\n\"Such then was the battle in Mirkwood.  Give me the mead-horn that I may\ndrink to the living and the dead, and the memory of the dead, and the\ndeeds of the living that are to be.\"\n\nSo they brought him the horn, and he waved it over his head and drank\nagain and spake:\n\n\"Sixty and three dead men of the Romans we counted there up and down that\noak-glade; and we cast earth over them; and three dead dastards of the\nGoths, and we left them for the wolves to deal with.  And twenty-five men\nof the Romans we took alive to be for hostages if need should be, and\nthese did we Shielding men, who are not very many, bring aback to the\nwain-burg; and the Daylings, who are a great company, were appointed to\nenter the wood and be with Thiodolf; and me did Otter bid to bear the\ntidings, even as I have told you.  And I have not loitered by the way.\"\n\nGreat then was the joy in the Hall; and they took Gisli, and made much of\nhim, and led him to the bath, and clad him in fine raiment taken from the\ncoffer which was but seldom opened, because the cloths it held were\nprecious; and they set a garland of green wheat-ears on his head.  Then\nthey fell to and spread the feast in the hall; and they ate and drank and\nwere merry.\n\nBut as for speeding the tidings, the Hall-Sun sent two women and two\nlads, all a-horseback, to bear the words: the women to remember the words\nwhich she taught them carefully, the lads to be handy with the horses, or\nin the ford, or the swimming of the deeps, or in the thicket.  So they\nwent their ways, down the water: one pair went on the western side, and\nthe other crossed Mirkwood-water at the shallows (for being Midsummer the\nwater was but small), and went along the east side, so that all the\nkindred might know of the tidings and rejoice.\n\nGreat was the glee in the Hall, though the warriors of the House were\naway, and many a song and lay they sang: but amidst the first of the\nsinging they bethought them of the old woman, and would have bidden her\ntell them some tale of times past, since she was so wise in the ancient\nlore.  But when they sought for her on all sides she was not to be found,\nnor could anyone remember seeing her depart from the Hall.  But this had\nthey no call to heed, and the feast ended, as it began, in great glee.\n\nAlbeit the Hall-Sun was troubled about the carline, both that she had\ncome, and that she had gone: and she determined that the next time she\nmet her she would strive to have of her a true tale of what she was, and\nof all that was toward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--THE HALL-SUN SAITH ANOTHER WORD\n\n\nIt was no later than the next night, and a many of what thralls were not\nwith the host were about in the feast-hall with the elders and lads and\nweaklings of the House; for last night's tidings had drawn them thither.\nGisli had gone back to his kindred and the wain-burg in the Upper-mark,\nand the women were sitting, most of them, in the Women's-Chamber, some of\nthem doing what little summer work needed doing about the looms, but more\nresting from their work in field and acre.\n\nThen came the Hall-Sun forth from her room clad in glittering raiment,\nand summoned no one, but went straight to her place on the dais under her\nnamesake the Lamp, and stood there a little without speaking.  Her face\nwas pale now, her lips a little open, her eyes set and staring as if they\nsaw nothing of all that was round about her.\n\nNow went the word through the Hall and the Women's-Chamber that the Hall-\nSun would speak again, and that great tidings were toward; so all folk\ncame flock-meal to the dais, both thralls and free; and scarce were all\ngathered there, ere the Hall-Sun began speaking, and said:\n\n   \"The days of the world thrust onward, and men are born therein\n   A many and a many, and divers deeds they win\n   In the fashioning of stories for the kindreds of the earth,\n   A garland interwoven of sorrow and of mirth.\n   To the world a warrior cometh; from the world he passeth away,\n   And no man then may sunder his good from his evil day.\n   By the Gods hath he been tormented, and been smitten by the foe:\n   He hath seen his maiden perish, he hath seen his speech-friend go:\n   His heart hath conceived a joyance and hath brought it unto birth:\n   But he hath not carried with him his sorrow or his mirth.\n   He hath lived, and his life hath fashioned the outcome of the deed,\n   For the blossom of the people, and the coming kindreds' seed.\n\n   \"Thus-wise the world is fashioned, and the new sun of the morn\n   Where earth last night was desert beholds a kindred born,\n   That to-morrow and to-morrow blossoms all gloriously\n   With many a man and maiden for the kindreds yet to be,\n   And fair the Goth-folk groweth.  And yet the story saith\n   That the deeds that make the summer make too the winter's death,\n   That summer-tides unceasing from out the grave may grow\n   And the spring rise up unblemished from the bosom of the snow.\n\n   \"Thus as to every kindred the day comes once for all\n   When yesterday it was not, and to-day it builds the hall,\n   So every kindred bideth the night-tide of the day,\n   Whereof it knoweth nothing, e'en when noon is past away.\n   E'en thus the House of the Wolfings 'twixt dusk and dark doth stand,\n   And narrow is the pathway with the deep on either hand.\n   On the left are the days forgotten, on the right the days to come,\n   And another folk and their story in the stead of the Wolfing home.\n   Do the shadows darken about it, is the even here at last?\n   Or is this but a storm of the noon-tide that the wind is driving past?\n\n   \"Unscathed as yet it standeth; it bears the stormy drift,\n   Nor bows to the lightening flashing adown from the cloudy lift.\n   I see the hail of battle and the onslaught of the strong,\n   And they go adown to the folk-mote that shall bide there over long.\n   I see the slain-heaps rising and the alien folk prevail,\n   And the Goths give back before them on the ridge o'er the treeless\n   vale.\n   I see the ancient fallen, and the young man smitten dead,\n   And yet I see the War-duke shake Throng-plough o'er his head,\n   And stand unhelmed, unbyrnied before the alien host,\n   And the hurt men rise around him to win back battle lost;\n   And the wood yield up her warriors, and the whole host rushing on,\n   And the swaying lines of battle until the lost is won.\n   Then forth goes the cry of triumph, as they ring the captives round\n   And cheat the crow of her portion and heap the warriors' mound.\n   There are faces gone from our feast-hall not the least beloved nor\n   worst,\n   But the wane of the House of the Wolfings not yet the world hath\n   cursed.\n   The sun shall rise to-morrow on our cold and dewy roof,\n   For they that longed for slaughter were slaughtered far aloof.\"\n\nShe ceased for a little, but her countenance, which had not changed\nduring her song, changed not at all now: so they all kept silence\nalthough they were rejoicing in this new tale of victory; for they deemed\nthat she was not yet at the end of her speaking.  And in good sooth she\nspake again presently, and said:\n\n   \"I wot not what hath befallen nor where my soul may be,\n   For confusion is within me and but dimly do I see,\n   As if the thing that I look on had happed a while ago.\n   They stand by the tofts of a war-garth, a captain of the foe,\n   And a man that is of the Goth-folk, and as friend and friend they\n   speak,\n   But I hear no word they are saying, though for every word I seek.\n   And now the mist flows round me and blind I come aback\n   To the House-roof of the Wolfings and the hearth that hath no lack.\"\n\nHer voice grew weaker as she spake the last words, and she sank backward\non to her chair: her clenched hands opened, the lids fell down over her\nbright eyes, her breast heaved no more as it had done, and presently she\nfell asleep.\n\nThe folk were doubtful and somewhat heavy-hearted because of those last\nwords of hers; but they would not ask her more, or rouse her from her\nsleep, lest they should grieve her; so they departed to their beds and\nslept for what was yet left of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--THE HALL-SUN IS CAREFUL CONCERNING THE PASSES OF THE WOOD\n\n\nIn the morning early folk arose; and the lads and women who were not of\nthe night-shift got them ready to go to the mead and the acres; for the\nsunshine had been plenty these last days and the wheat was done\nblossoming, and all must be got ready for harvest.  So they broke their\nfast, and got their tools into their hands: but they were somewhat heavy-\nhearted because of those last words of the Hall-Sun, and the doubt of\nlast night still hung about them, and they were scarcely as merry as men\nare wont to be in the morning.\n\nAs for the Hall-Sun, she was afoot with the earliest, and was no less,\nbut mayhap more merry than her wont was, and was blithe with all, both\nold and young.\n\nBut as they were at the point of going she called to them, and said:\n\n\"Tarry a little, come ye all to the dais and hearken to me.\"\n\nSo they all gathered thereto, and she stood in her place and spake.\n\n\"Women and elders of the Wolfings, is it so that I spake somewhat of\ntidings last night?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said they all.\n\nShe said, \"And was it a word of victory?\"\n\nThey answered \"yea\" again.\n\n\"Good is that,\" she said; \"doubt ye not! there is nought to unsay.  But\nhearken!  I am nothing wise in war like Thiodolf or Otter of the Laxings,\nor as Heriulf the Ancient was, though he was nought so wise as they be.\nNevertheless ye shall do well to take me for your captain, while this\nHouse is bare of warriors.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" they said, \"so will we.\"\n\nAnd an old warrior, hight Sorli, who sat in his chair, no longer quite\nway-worthy, said:\n\n\"Hall-Sun, this we looked for of thee; since thy wisdom is not wholly the\nwisdom of a spae-wife, but rather is of the children of warriors: and we\nknow thine heart to be high and proud, and that thy death seemeth to thee\na small matter beside the life of the Wolfing House.\"\n\nThen she smiled and said, \"Will ye all do my bidding?\"\n\nAnd they all cried out heartily, \"Yea, Hall-Sun, that will we.\"\n\nShe said: \"Hearken then; ye all know that east of Mirkwood-water, when ye\ncome to the tofts of the Bearings, and their Great Roof, the thicket\nbehind them is close, but that there is a wide way cut through it; and\noften have I gone there: if ye go by that way, in a while ye come to the\nthicket's end and to bare places where the rocks crop up through the\ngravel and the woodland loam.  There breed the coneys without number; and\nwild-cats haunt the place for that sake, and foxes; and the wood-wolf\nwalketh there in summer-tide, and hard by the she-wolf hath her litter of\nwhelps, and all these have enough; and the bald-head erne hangeth over it\nand the kite, and also the kestril, for shrews and mice abound there.  Of\nthese things there is none that feareth me, and none that maketh me\nafraid.  Beyond this place for a long way the wood is nowise thick, for\nfirst grow ash-trees about the clefts of the rock and also quicken-trees,\nbut not many of either; and here and there a hazel brake easy to thrust\nthrough; then comes a space of oak-trees scattered about the lovely wood-\nlawn, and then at last the beech-wood close above but clear beneath.  This\nI know well, because I myself have gone so far and further; and by this\neasy way have I gone so far to the south, that I have come out into the\nfell country, and seen afar off the snowy mountains beyond the Great\nWater.\n\n\"Now fear ye not, but pluck up a heart!  For either I have seen it or\ndreamed it, or thought it, that by this road easy to wend the Romans\nshould come into the Mark.  For shall not those dastards and traitors\nthat wear the raiment and bodies of the Goths over the hearts and the\nlives of foemen, tell them hereof?  And will they not have heard of our\nThiodolf, and this my holy namesake?\n\n\"Will they not therefore be saying to themselves, 'Go to now, why should\nwe wrench the hinges off the door with plenteous labour, when another\ndoor to the same chamber standeth open before us?  This House of the\nWolfings is the door to the treasure chamber of the Markmen; let us fall\non that at once rather than have many battles for other lesser matters,\nand then at last have to fight for this also: for having this we have\nall, and they shall be our thralls, and we may slaughter what we will,\nand torment what we will and deflower what we will, and make our souls\nglad with their grief and anguish, and take aback with us to the cities\nwhat we will of the thralls, that their anguish and our joy may endure\nthe longer.'  Thus will they say: therefore is it my rede that the\nstrongest and hardiest of you women take horse, a ten of you and one to\nlead besides, and ride the shallows to the Bearing House, and tell them\nof our rede; which is to watch diligently the ways of the wood; the\noutgate to the Mark, and the places where the wood is thin and easy to\ntravel on: and ye shall bid them give you of their folk as many as they\ndeem fittest thereto to join your company, so that ye may have a chain of\nwatchers stretching far into the wilds; but two shall lie without the\nwood, their horses ready for them to leap on and ride on the spur to the\nwain-burg in the Upper-mark if any tidings befal.\n\n\"Now of these eleven I ordain Hrosshild to be the leader and captain, and\nto choose for her fellows the stoutest-limbed and heaviest-handed of all\nthe maidens here: art thou content Hrosshild?\"\n\nThen stood Hrosshild forth and said nought, but nodded yea; and soon was\nher choice made amid jests and laughter, for this seemed no hard matter\nto them.\n\nSo the ten got together, and the others fell off from them, and there\nstood the ten maidens with Hrosshild, well nigh as strong as men, clean-\nlimbed and tall, tanned with sun and wind; for all these were unwearied\nafield, and oft would lie out a-nights, since they loved the lark's song\nbetter than the mouse's squeak; but as their kirtles shifted at neck and\nwrist, you might see their skins as white as privet-flower where they\nwere wont to be covered.\n\nThen said the Hall-Sun: \"Ye have heard the word, see ye to it, Hrosshild,\nand take this other word also: Bid the Bearing stay-at-homes bide not the\nsword and the torch at home if the Romans come, but hie them over hither,\nto hold the Hall or live in the wild-wood with us, as need may be; for\nmight bides with many.\n\n\"But ye maidens, take this counsel for yourselves; do ye each bear with\nyou a little keen knife, and if ye be taken, and it seem to you that ye\nmay not bear the smart of the Roman torments (for they be wise in\ntormenting), but will speak and bewray us under them, then thrust this\nlittle edge tool into the place of your bodies where the life lieth\nclosest, and so go to the Gods with a good tale in your mouths: so may\nthe Almighty God of Earth speed you, and the fathers of the kindred!\"\n\nSo she spoke; and they made no delay but each one took what axe or spear\nor sword she liked best, and two had their bows and quivers of arrows;\nand so all folk went forth from the Hall.\n\nSoon were the horses saddled and bridled, and the maidens bestrode them\njoyously and set forth on their way, going down the lanes of the wheat,\nand rode down speedily toward the shallows of the water, and all cried\ngood speed after them.  But the others would turn to their day's work,\nand would go about their divers errands.  But even as they were at point\nto sunder, they saw a swift runner passing by those maidens just where\nthe acres joined the meadow, and he waved his hand aloft and shouted to\nthem, but stayed not his running for them, but came up the lanes of the\nwheat at his swiftest: so they knew at once that this was again a\nmessenger from the host, and they stood together and awaited his coming;\nand as he drew near they knew him for Egil, the swiftest-footed of the\nWolfings; and he gave a great shout as he came among them; and he was\ndusty and way-worn, but eager; and they received him with all love, and\nwould have brought him to the Hall to wash him and give him meat and\ndrink, and cherish him in all ways.\n\nBut he cried out, \"To the Speech-Hill first, to the Speech-Hill first!\nBut even before that, one word to thee, Hall-Sun!  Saith Thiodolf, Send\nye watchers to look to the entrance into Mid-mark, which is by the\nBearing dwelling; and if aught untoward befalleth let one ride on the\nspur with the tidings to the Wain-burg.  For by that way also may peril\ncome.\"\n\nThen smiled some of the bystanders, and the Hall-Sun said: \"Good is it\nwhen the thought of a friend stirreth betimes in one's own breast.  The\nthing is done, Egil; or sawest thou not those ten women, and Hrosshild\nthe eleventh, as thou camest up into the acres?\"\n\nSaid Egil; \"Fair fall thine hand, Hall-Sun! thou art the Wolfings'\nRansom.  Wend we now to the Speech-Hill.\"\n\nSo did they, and every thrall that was about the dwellings, man, woman,\nand child fared with them, and stood about the Speech-Hill: and the dogs\nwent round about the edge of that assembly, wandering in and out, and\nsometimes looking hard on some one whom they knew best, if he cried out\naloud.\n\nBut the men-folk gave all their ears to hearkening, and stood as close as\nthey might.\n\nThen Egil clomb the Speech-Hill, and said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--THEY HEAR TELL OF THE BATTLE ON THE RIDGE\n\n\n\"Ye have heard how the Daylings were appointed to go to help Thiodolf in\ndriving the folk-spear home to the heart of the Roman host.  So they\nwent; but six hours thereafter comes one to Otter bidding him send a\ngreat part of the kindreds to him; for that he had had tidings that a\ngreat host of Romans were drawing near the wood-edge, but were not\nentered therein, and that fain would he meet them in the open field.\n\n\"So the kindreds drew lots, and the lot fell first to the Elkings, who\nare a great company, as ye know; and then to the Hartings, the Beamings,\nthe Alftings, the Vallings (also a great company), the Galtings, (and\nthey no lesser) each in their turn; and last of all to the Laxings; and\nthe Oselings prayed to go with the Elkings, and this Otter deemed good,\nwhereas a many of them be bowmen.\n\n\"All these then to the number of a thousand or more entered the wood; and\nI was with them, for in sooth I was the messenger.\n\n\"No delay made we in the wood, nor went we over warily, trusting to the\nwarding of the wood by Thiodolf; and there were men with us who knew the\npaths well, whereof I was one; so we speedily came through into the open\ncountry.\n\n\"Shortly we came upon our folk and the War-duke lying at the foot of a\nlittle hill that went up as a buttress to a long ridge high above us,\nwhereon we set a watch; and a little brook came down the dale for our\ndrink.\n\n\"Night fell as we came thither; so we slept for a while, but abode not\nthe morning, and we were afoot (for we had no horses with us) before the\nmoon grew white.  We took the road in good order, albeit our folk-banners\nwe had left behind in the burg; so each kindred raised aloft a shield of\nits token to be for a banner.  So we went forth, and some swift footmen,\nwith Fox, who hath seen the Roman war-garth, had been sent on before to\nspy out the ways of the foemen.\n\n\"Two hours after sunrise cometh one of these, and telleth how he hath\nseen the Romans, and how that they are but a short mile hence breaking\ntheir fast, not looking for any onslaught; 'but,' saith he, 'they are on\na high ridge whence they can see wide about, and be in no danger of\nambush, because the place is bare for the most part, nor is there any\ncover except here and there down in the dales a few hazels and blackthorn\nbushes, and the rushes of the becks in the marshy bottoms, wherein a\nsnipe may hide, or a hare, but scarce a man; and note that there is no\nway up to that ridge but by a spur thereof as bare as my hand; so ye will\nbe well seen as ye wend up thereto.'\n\n\"So spake he in my hearing.  But Thiodolf bade him lead on to that spur,\nand old Heriulf, who was standing nigh, laughed merrily and said: 'Yea,\nlead on, and speedily, lest the day wane and nothing done save the\nhunting of snipes.'\n\n\"So on we went, and coming to the hither side of that spur beheld those\nothers and Fox with them; and he held in his hand an arrow of the aliens,\nand his face was all astir with half-hidden laughter, and he breathed\nhard, and pointed to the ridge, and somewhat low down on it we saw a\nsteel cap and three spear-heads showing white from out a little hollow in\nits side, but the men hidden by the hollow: so we knew that Fox had been\nchased, and that the Romans were warned and wary.\n\n\"No delay made the War-duke, but led us up that spur, which was somewhat\nsteep; and as we rose higher we saw a band of men on the ridge, a little\nway down it, not a many; archers and slingers mostly, who abode us till\nwe were within shot, and then sent a few shots at us, and so fled.  But\ntwo men were hurt with the sling-plummets, and one, and he not\ngrievously, with an arrow, and not one slain.\n\n\"Thus we came up on to the ridge, so that there was nothing between us\nand the bare heavens; thence we looked south-east and saw the Romans\nwisely posted on the ridge not far from where it fell down steeply to the\nnorth; but on the south, that is to say on their left hands, and all\nalong the ridge past where we were stayed, the ground sloped gently to\nthe south-west for a good way, before it fell, somewhat steeply, into\nanother long dale.  Looking north we saw the outer edge of Mirkwood but a\nlittle way from us, and we were glad thereof; because ere we left our\nsleeping-place that morn Thiodolf had sent to Otter another messenger\nbidding him send yet more men on to us in case we should be hard-pressed\nin the battle; for he had had a late rumour that the Romans were many.\nAnd now when he had looked on the Roman array and noted how wise it was,\nhe sent three swift-foot ones to take stand on a high knoll which we had\npassed on the way, that they might take heed where our folk came out from\nthe wood and give signal to them by the horn, and lead them to where the\nbattle should be.\n\n\"So we stood awhile and breathed us, and handled our weapons some half a\nfurlong from the alien host.  They had no earth rampart around them, for\nthat ridge is waterless, and they could not abide there long, but they\nhad pitched sharp pales in front of them and they stood in very good\norder, as if abiding an onslaught, and moved not when they saw us; for\nthat band of shooters had joined themselves to them already.  Taken one\nwith another we deemed them to be more than we were; but their hauberked\nfootmen with the heavy cast-spears not so many as we by a good deal.\n\n\"Now we were of mind to fall on them ere they should fall on us; so all\nsuch of us as had shot-weapons spread out from our company and went forth\na little; and of the others Heriulf stood foremost along with the leaders\nof the Beamings and the Elkings; but as yet Thiodolf held aback and led\nthe midmost company, as his wont was, and the more part of the Wolfings\nwere with him.\n\n\"Thus we ordered ourselves, and awaited a little while yet what the\naliens should do; and presently a war-horn blew amongst them, and from\neach flank of their mailed footmen came forth a many bowmen and slingers\nand a band of horsemen; and drew within bowshot, the shooters in open\narray yet wisely, and so fell to on us, and the horsemen hung aback a\nlittle as yet.\n\n\"Their arrow-shot was of little avail, their bowmen fell fast before\nours; but deadly was their sling-shot, and hurt and slew many and some\neven in our main battle; for they slung round leaden balls and not\nstones, and they aimed true and shot quick; and the men withal were so\nlight and lithe, never still, but crouching and creeping and bounding\nhere and there, that they were no easier to hit than coneys amidst of the\nfern, unless they were very nigh.\n\n\"Howbeit when this storm had endured a while, and we moved but little,\nand not an inch aback, and gave them shot for shot, then was another horn\nwinded from amongst the aliens; and thereat the bowmen cast down their\nbows, and the slingers wound their slings about their heads, and they all\ncame on with swords and short spears and feathered darts, running and\nleaping lustily, making for our flanks, and the horsemen set spurs to\ntheir horses and fell on in the very front of our folk like good and\nvaliant men-at-arms.\n\n\"That saw Heriulf and his men, and they set up the war-whoop, and ran\nforth to meet them, axe and sword aloft, terribly yet maybe somewhat\nunwarily.  The archers and slingers never came within sword-stroke of\nthem, but fell away before them on all sides; but the slingers fled not\nfar, but began again with their shot, and slew a many.  Then was a horn\nwinded, as if to call back the horsemen, who, if they heard, heeded not,\nbut rode hard on our kindred like valiant warriors who feared not death.\nSooth to say, neither were the horses big or good, nor the men fit for\nthe work, saving for their hardihood; and their spears were short withal\nand their bucklers unhandy to wield.\n\n\"Now could it be seen how the Goths gave way before them to let them into\nthe trap, and then closed around again, and the axes and edge weapons\nwent awork hewing as in a wood; and Heriulf towered over all the press,\nand the Wolf's-sister flashed over his head in the summer morning.\n\n\"Soon was that storm over, and we saw the Goths tossing up their spears\nover the slain, and horses running loose and masterless adown over the\nwestward-lying slopes, and a few with their riders still clinging to\nthem.  Yet some, sore hurt by seeming, galloping toward the main battle\nof the Romans.\n\n\"Unwarily then fared the children of Tyr that were with Heriulf; for by\nthis time they were well nigh within shot of the spears of those mighty\nfootmen of the Romans: and on their flanks were the slingers, and the\nbowmen, who had now gotten their bows again; and our bowmen, though they\nshot well and strong, were too few to quell them; and indeed some of them\nhad cast by their bows to join in Heriulf's storm.  Also the lie of the\nground was against us, for it sloped up toward the Roman array at first\nvery gently, but afterwards steeply enough to breathe a short-winded man.\nAlso behind them were we of the other kindreds, whom Thiodolf had ordered\ninto the wedge-array; and we were all ready to move forward, so that had\nthey abided somewhat, all had been well and better.\n\n\"So did they not, but straightway set up the Victory-whoop and ran\nforward on the Roman host.  And these were so ordered that, as aforesaid,\nthey had before them sharp piles stuck into the earth and pointed against\nus, as we found afterwards to our cost; and within these piles stood the\nmen some way apart from each other, so as to handle their casting spears,\nand in three ranks were they ordered and many spears could be cast at\nonce, and if any in the front were slain, his fellow behind him took his\nplace.\n\n\"So now the storm of war fell at once upon our folk, and swift and fierce\nas was their onslaught yet were a many slain and hurt or ever they came\nto the piles aforesaid.  Then saw they death before them and heeded it\nnought, but tore up the piles and dashed through them, and fell in on\nthose valiant footmen.  Short is the tale to tell: wheresoever a sword or\nspear of the Goths was upraised there were three upon him, and saith Toti\nof the Beamings, who was hurt and crawled away and yet lives, that on\nHeriulf there were six at first and then more; and he took no thought of\nshielding himself, but raised up the Wolf's-sister and hewed as the\nwoodman in the thicket, when night cometh and hunger is on him.  There\nfell Heriulf the Ancient and many a man of the Beamings and the Elkings\nwith him, and many a Roman.\n\n\"But amidst the slain and the hurt our wedge-array moved forward slowly\nnow, warily shielded against the plummets and shafts on either side; and\nwhen the Romans saw our unbroken array, and Thiodolf the first with\nThrong-plough naked in his hand, they chased not such men of ours unhurt\nor little hurt, as drew aback from before them: so these we took amongst\nus, and when we had gotten all we might, and held a grim face to the foe,\nwe drew aback little by little, still facing them till we were out of\nshot of their spears, though the shot of the arrows and the\nsling-plummets ceased not wholly from us.  Thus ended Heriulf's Storm.\"\n\nThen he rested from his speaking for a while, and none said aught, but\nthey gazed on him as if he bore with him a picture of the battle, and\nmany of the women wept silently for Heriulf, and yet more of the younger\nones were wounded to the heart when they thought of the young men of the\nElkings, and the Beamings, since with both those houses they had\naffinity; and they lamented the loves that they had lost, and would have\nasked concerning their own speech-friends had they durst.  But they held\ntheir peace till the tale was told out to an end.\n\nThen Egil spake again:\n\n\"No long while had worn by in Heriulf's Storm, and though men's hearts\nwere nothing daunted, but rather angered by what had befallen, yet would\nThiodolf wear away the time somewhat more, since he hoped for succour\nfrom the Wain-burg and the Wood; and he would not that any of these\nRomans should escape us, but would give them all to Tyr, and to be a\nfollowing to Heriulf the Old and the Great.\n\n\"So there we abided a while moving nought, and Thiodolf stood with Throng-\nplough on his shoulder, unhelmed, unbyrnied, as though he trusted to the\nkindred for all defence.  Nor for their part did the Romans dare to leave\ntheir vantage-ground, when they beheld what grim countenance we made\nthem.\n\n\"Albeit, when we had thrice made as if we would fall on, and yet they\nmoved not, whereas it trieth a man sorely to stand long before the\nfoeman, and do nought but endure, and whereas many of our bowmen were\nslain or hurt, and the rest too few to make head against the shot-weapons\nof the aliens, then at last we began to draw nearer and a little nearer,\nnot breaking the wedge-array; and at last, just before we were within\nshot of the cast-spears of their main battle, loud roared our war-horn:\nthen indeed we broke the wedge-array, but orderly as we knew how,\nspreading out from right and left of the War-duke till we were facing\nthem in a long line: one minute we abode thus, and then ran forth through\nthe spear-storm: and even therewith we heard, as it were, the echo of our\nown horn, and whoso had time to think betwixt the first of the storm and\nthe handstrokes of the Romans deemed that now would be coming fresh\nkindreds for our helping.\n\n\"Not long endured the spear-rain, so swift we were, neither were we in\none throng as betid in Heriulf's Storm, but spread abroad, each trusting\nin the other that none thought of the backward way.\n\n\"Though we had the ground against us we dashed like fresh men at their\npales, and were under the weapons at once.  Then was the battle grim;\nthey could not thrust us back, nor did we break their array with our\nfirst storm; man hewed at man as if there were no foes in the world but\nthey two: sword met sword, and sax met sax; it was thrusting and hewing\nwith point and edge, and no long-shafted weapons were of any avail; there\nwe fought hand to hand and no man knew by eyesight how the battle went\ntwo yards from where he fought, and each one put all his heart in the\nstroke he was then striking, and thought of nothing else.\n\n\"Yet at the last we felt that they were faltering and that our work was\neasier and our hope higher; then we cried our cries and pressed on\nharder, and in that very nick of time there arose close behind us the\nroar of the Markmen's horn and the cries of the kindreds answering ours.\nThen such of the Romans as were not in the very act of smiting, or\nthrusting, or clinging or shielding, turned and fled, and the whoop of\nvictory rang around us, and the earth shook, and past the place of the\nslaughter rushed the riders of the Goths; for they had sent horsemen to\nus, and the paths were grown easier for our much treading of them.  Then\nI beheld Thiodolf, that he had just slain a foe, and clear was the space\naround him, and he rushed sideways and caught hold of the stirrup of\nAngantyr of the Bearings, and ran ten strides beside him, and then\nbounded on afoot swifter than the red horses of the Bearings, urging on\nthe chase, as his wont was.\n\n\"But we who were wearier, when we had done our work, stood still between\nthe living and the dead, between the freemen of the Mark and their war-\nthralls.  And in no long while there came back to us Thiodolf and the\nchasers, and we made a great ring on the field of the slain, and sang the\nSong of Triumph; and it was the Wolfing Song that we sang.\n\n\"Thus then ended Thiodolf's Storm.\"\n\nWhen he held his peace there was but little noise among the\nstay-at-homes, for still were they thinking about the deaths of their\nkindred and their lovers.  But Egil spoke again.\n\n\"Yet within that ring lay the sorrow of our hearts; for Odin had called a\nmany home, and there lay their bodies; and the mightiest was Heriulf; and\nthe Romans had taken him up from where he fell, and cast him down out of\nthe way, but they had not stripped him, and his hand still gripped the\nWolf's-sister.  His shield was full of shafts of arrows and spears; his\nbyrny was rent in many places, his helm battered out of form.  He had\nbeen grievously hurt in the side and in the thigh by cast-spears or ever\nhe came to hand-blows with the Romans, but moreover he had three great\nwounds from the point of the sax, in the throat, in the side, in the\nbelly, each enough for his bane.  His face was yet fair to look on, and\nwe deemed that he had died smiling.\n\n\"At his feet lay a young man of the Beamings in a gay green coat, and\nbeside him was the head of another of his House, but his green-clad body\nlay some yards aloof.  There lay of the Elkings a many.  Well may ye\nweep, maidens, for them that loved you.  Now fare they to the Gods a\ngoodly company, but a goodly company is with them.\n\n\"Seventy and seven of the Sons of the Goths lay dead within the Roman\nbattle, and fifty-four on the slope before it; and to boot there were\ntwenty-four of us slain by the arrows and plummets of the shooters, and a\nmany hurt withal.\n\n\"But there were no hurt men inside the Roman array or before it.  All\nwere slain outright, for the hurt men either dragged themselves back to\nour folk, or onward to the Roman ranks, that they might die with one more\nstroke smitten.\n\n\"Now of the aliens the dead lay in heaps in that place, for grim was the\nslaughter when the riders of the Bearings and the Wormings fell on the\naliens; and a many of the foemen scorned to flee, but died where they\nstood, craving no peace; and to few of them was peace given.  There fell\nof the Roman footmen five hundred and eighty and five, and the remnant\nthat fled was but little: but of the slingers and bowmen but eighty and\nsix were slain, for they were there to shoot and not to stand; and they\nwere nimble and fleet of foot, men round of limb, very dark-skinned, but\nnot foul of favour.\"\n\nThen he said:\n\n   \"There are men through the dusk a-faring, our speech-fiends and our\n   kin,\n   No more shall they crave our helping, nor ask what work to win;\n   They have done their deeds and departed when they had holpen the\n   House,\n   So high their heads are holden, and their hurts are glorious\n   With the story of strokes stricken, and new weapons to be met,\n   And new scowling of foes' faces, and new curses unknown yet.\n   Lo, they dight the feast in Godhome, and fair are the tables spread,\n   Late come, but well-beloved is every war-worn head,\n   And the God-folk and the Fathers, as these cross the tinkling bridge,\n   Crowd round and crave for stories of the Battle on the Ridge.\"\n\nTherewith he came down from the Speech-Hill and the women-folk came round\nabout him, and they brought him to the Hall, and washed him, and gave him\nmeat and drink; and then would he sleep, for he was weary.\n\nHowbeit some of the women could not refrain themselves, but must needs\nask after their speech-friends who had been in the battle; and he\nanswered as he could, and some he made glad, and some sorry; and as to\nsome, he could not tell them whether their friends were alive or dead.  So\nhe went to his place and fell asleep and slept long, while the women went\ndown to acre and meadow, or saw to the baking of bread or the sewing of\ngarments, or went far afield to tend the neat and the sheep.\n\nHowbeit the Hall-Sun went not with them; but she talked with that old\nwarrior, Sorli, who was now halt and grown unmeet for the road, but was a\nwise man; and she and he together with some old carlines and a few young\nlads fell to work, and saw to many matters about the Hall and the garth\nthat day; and they got together what weapons there were both for shot and\nfor the handplay, and laid them where they were handy to come at, and\nthey saw to the meal in the hall that there was provision for many days;\nand they carried up to a loft above the Women's-Chamber many great\nvessels of water, lest the fire should take the Hall; and they looked\neverywhere to the entrances and windows and had fastenings and bolts and\nbars fashioned and fitted to them; and saw that all things were trim and\nstout.  And so they abided the issue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--HOW THE DWARF-WROUGHT HAUBERK WAS BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE HALL\nOF THE DAYLINGS\n\n\nNow it must be told that early in the morning, after the night when Gisli\nhad brought to the Wolfing Stead the tidings of the Battle in the Wood, a\nman came riding from the south to the Dayling abode.  It was just before\nsunrise, and but few folk were stirring about the dwellings.  He rode up\nto the Hall and got off his black horse, and tied it to a ring in the\nwall by the Man's-door, and went in clashing, for he was in his battle-\ngear, and had a great wide-rimmed helm on his head.\n\nFolk were but just astir in the Hall, and there came an old woman to him,\nand looked on him and saw by his attire that he was a man of the Goths\nand of the Wolfing kindred; so she greeted him kindly: but he said:\n\n\"Mother, I am come hither on an errand, and time presses.\"\n\nSaid she: \"Yea, my son, or what tidings bearest thou from the south? for\nby seeming thou art new-come from the host.\"\n\nSaid he: \"The tidings are as yesterday, save that Thiodolf will lead the\nhost through the wild-wood to look for the Romans beyond it: therefore\nwill there soon be battle again.  See ye, Mother, hast thou here one that\nknoweth this ring of Thiodolf's, if perchance men doubt me when I say\nthat I am sent on my errand by him?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"Agni will know it; since he knoweth all the chief men\nof the Mark; but what is thine errand, and what is thy name?\"\n\n\"It is soon told,\" said he, \"I am a Wolfing hight Thorkettle, and I come\nto have away for Thiodolf the treasure of the world, the Dwarf-wrought\nHauberk, which he left with you when we fared hence to the south three\ndays ago.  Now let Agni come, that I may have it, for time presses\nsorely.\"\n\nThere were three or four gathered about them now, and a maiden of them\nsaid: \"Shall I bring Agni hither, mother?\"\n\n\"What needeth it?\" said the carline, \"he sleepeth, and shall be hard to\nawaken; and he is old, so let him sleep.  I shall go fetch the hauberk,\nfor I know where it is, and my hand may come on it as easily as on mine\nown girdle.\"\n\nSo she went her ways to the treasury where were the precious things of\nthe kindred; the woven cloths were put away in fair coffers to keep them\nclean from the whirl of the Hall-dust and the reek; and the vessels of\ngold and some of silver were standing on the shelves of a cupboard before\nwhich hung a veil of needlework: but the weapons and war-gear hung upon\npins along the wall, and many of them had much fair work on them, and\nwere dight with gold and gems: but amidst them all was the wondrous\nhauberk clear to see, dark grey and thin, for it was so wondrously\nwrought that it hung in small compass.  So the carline took it down from\nthe pin, and handled it, and marvelled at it, and said:\n\n\"Strange are the hands that have passed over thee, sword-rampart, and in\nstrange places of the earth have they dwelt!  For no smith of the\nkindreds hath fashioned thee, unless he had for his friend either a God\nor a foe of the Gods.  Well shalt thou wot of the tale of sword and spear\nere thou comest back hither!  For Thiodolf shall bring thee where the\nwork is wild.\"\n\nThen she went with the hauberk to the new-come warrior, and made no\ndelay, but gave it to him, and said:\n\n\"When Agni awaketh, I shall tell him that Thorkettle of the Wolfings hath\nborne aback to Thiodolf the Treasure of the World, the Dwarf-wrought\nHauberk.\"\n\nThen Thorkettle took it and turned to go; but even therewith came old\nAsmund from out of his sleeping-place, and gazed around the Hall, and his\neyes fell on the shape of the Wolfing as he was going out of the door,\nand he asked the carline.\n\n\"What doeth he here?  What tidings is there from the host?  For my soul\nwas nought unquiet last night.\"\n\n\"It is a little matter,\" she said; \"the War-duke hath sent for the\nwondrous Byrny that he left in our treasury when he departed to meet the\nRomans.  Belike there shall be a perilous battle, and few hearts need a\nstout sword-wall more than Thiodolf's.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Thorkettle had passed the door, and got into his saddle,\nand sat his black horse like a mighty man as he slowly rode down the turf\nbridge that led into the plain.  And Asmund went to the door and stood\nwatching him till he set spurs to his horse, and departed a great gallop\nto the south.  Then said Asmund:\n\n   \"What then are the Gods devising, what wonders do they will?\n   What mighty need is on them to work the kindreds ill,\n   That the seed of the Ancient Fathers and a woman of their kin\n   With her all unfading beauty must blend herself therein?\n   Are they fearing lest the kindreds should grow too fair and great,\n   And climb the stairs of God-home, and fashion all their fate,\n   And make all earth so merry that it never wax the worse,\n   Nor need a gift from any, nor prayers to quench the curse?\n   Fear they that the Folk-wolf, growing as the fire from out the spark\n   Into a very folk-god, shall lead the weaponed Mark\n   From wood to field and mountain, to stand between the earth\n   And the wrights that forge its thraldom and the sword to slay its\n   mirth?\n   Fear they that the sons of the wild-wood the Loathly Folk shall quell,\n   And grow into Gods thereafter, and aloof in God-home dwell?\"\n\nTherewith he turned back into the Hall, and was heavy-hearted and dreary\nof aspect; for he was somewhat foreseeing; and it may not be hidden that\nthis seeming Thorkettle was no warrior of the Wolfings, but the Wood-Sun\nin his likeness; for she had the power and craft of shape-changing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--THE WOOD-SUN SPEAKETH WITH THIODOLF\n\n\nNow the Markmen laid Heriulf in howe on the ridge-crest where he had\nfallen, and heaped a mighty howe over him that could be seen from far,\nand round about him they laid the other warriors of the kindreds.  For\nthey deemed it was fittest that they should lie on the place whose story\nthey had fashioned.  But they cast earth on the foemen lower down on the\nwestward-lying bents.\n\nThe sun set amidst their work, and night came on; and Thiodolf was weary\nand would fain rest him and sleep: but he had many thoughts, and pondered\nwhitherward he should lead the folk, so as to smite the Romans once\nagain, and he had a mind to go apart and be alone for rest and slumber;\nso he spoke to a man of the kindred named Solvi in whom he put all trust,\nand then he went down from the ridge, and into a little dale on the\nsouthwest side thereof, a furlong from the place of the battle.  A beck\nran down that dale, and the further end of it was closed by a little wood\nof yew trees, low, but growing thick together, and great grey stones were\nscattered up and down on the short grass of the dale.  Thiodolf went down\nto the brook-side, and to a place where it trickled into a pool, whence\nit ran again in a thin thread down the dale, turning aside before it\nreached the yew-wood to run its ways under low ledges of rock into a\nwider dale.  He looked at the pool and smiled to himself as if he had\nthought of something that pleased him; then he drew a broad knife from\nhis side, and fell to cutting up turfs till he had what he wanted; and\nthen he brought stones to the place, and built a dam across the mouth of\nthe pool, and sat by on a great stone to watch it filling.\n\nAs he sat he strove to think about the Roman host and how he should deal\nwith it; but despite himself his thoughts wandered, and made for him\npictures of his life that should be when this time of battle was over; so\nthat he saw nothing of the troubles that were upon his hands that night,\nbut rather he saw himself partaking in the deeds of the life of man.\nThere he was between the plough-stilts in the acres of the kindred when\nthe west wind was blowing over the promise of early spring; or smiting\ndown the ripe wheat in the hot afternoon amidst the laughter and merry\ntalk of man and maid; or far away over Mirkwood-water watching the edges\nof the wood against the prowling wolf and lynx, the stars just beginning\nto shine over his head, as now they were; or wending the windless woods\nin the first frosts before the snow came, the hunter's bow or javelin in\nhand: or coming back from the wood with the quarry on the sledge across\nthe snow, when winter was deep, through the biting icy wind and the whirl\nof the drifting snow, to the lights and music of the Great Roof, and the\nmerry talk therein and the smiling of the faces glad to see the hunting-\ncarles come back; and the full draughts of mead, and the sweet rest a\nnight-tide when the north wind was moaning round the ancient home.\n\nAll seemed good and fair to him, and whiles he looked around him, and saw\nthe long dale lying on his left hand and the dark yews in its jaws\npressing up against the rock-ledges of the brook, and on his right its\nwindings as the ground rose up to the buttresses of the great ridge.  The\nmoon was rising over it, and he heard the voice of the brook as it\ntinkled over the stones above him; and the whistle of the plover and the\nlaugh of the whimbrel came down the dale sharp and clear in the calm\nevening; and sounding far away, because the great hill muffled them, were\nthe voices of his fellows on the ridge, and the songs of the warriors and\nthe high-pitched cries of the watch.  And this also was a part of the\nsweet life which was, and was to be; and he smiled and was happy and\nloved the days that were coming, and longed for them, as the young man\nlongs for the feet of his maiden at the trysting-place.\n\nSo as he sat there, the dreams wrapping him up from troublous thoughts,\nat last slumber overtook him, and the great warrior of the Wolfings sat\nnodding like an old carle in the chimney ingle, and he fell asleep, his\ndreams going with him, but all changed and turned to folly and emptiness.\n\nHe woke with a start in no long time; the night was deep, the wind had\nfallen utterly, and all sounds were stilled save the voice of the brook,\nand now and again the cry of the watchers of the Goths.  The moon was\nhigh and bright, and the little pool beside him glittered with it in all\nits ripples; for it was full now and trickling over the lip of his dam.\nSo he arose from the stone and did off his war-gear, casting\nThrong-plough down into the grass beside him, for he had been minded to\nbathe him, but the slumber was still on him, and he stood musing while\nthe stream grew stronger and pushed off first one of his turfs and then\nanother, and rolled two or three of the stones over, and then softly\nthrust all away and ran with a gush down the dale, filling all the little\nbights by the way for a minute or two; he laughed softly thereat, and\nstayed the undoing of his kirtle, and so laid himself down on the grass\nbeside the stone looking down the dale, and fell at once into a dreamless\nsleep.\n\nWhen he awoke again, it was yet night, but the moon was getting lower and\nthe first beginnings of dawn were showing in the sky over the ridge; he\nlay still a moment gathering his thoughts and striving to remember where\nhe was, as is the wont of men waking from deep sleep; then he leapt to\nhis feet, and lo, he was face to face with a woman, and she who but the\nWood-Sun? and he wondered not, but reached out his hand to touch her,\nthough he had not yet wholly cast off the heaviness of slumber or\nremembered the tidings of yesterday.\n\nShe drew aback a little from him, and his eyes cleared of the slumber,\nand he saw her that she was scantily clad in black raiment, barefoot,\nwith no gold ring on her arms or necklace on her neck, or crown about her\nhead.  But she looked so fair and lovely even in that end of the night-\ntide, that he remembered all her beauty of the day and the sunshine, and\nhe laughed aloud for joy of the sight of her, and said:\n\n\"What aileth thee, O Wood-Sun, and is this a new custom of thy kindred\nand the folk of God-home that their brides array themselves like thralls\nnew-taken, and as women who have lost their kindred and are outcast?  Who\nthen hath won the Burg of the Anses, and clomb the rampart of God-home?\"\n\nBut she spoke from where she stood in a voice so sweet, that it thrilled\nto the very marrow of his bones.\n\n   \"I have dwelt a while with sorrow since we met, we twain, in the wood:\n   I have mourned, while thou hast been merry, who deemest the war-play\n   good.\n   For I know the heart of the wilful and how thou wouldst cast away\n   The rampart of thy life-days, and the wall of my happy day.\n   Yea I am the thrall of Sorrow; she hath stripped my raiment off\n   And laid sore stripes upon me with many a bitter scoff.\n   Still bidding me remember that I come of the God-folk's kin,\n   And yet for all my godhead no love of thee may win.\"\n\nThen she looked longingly at him a while and at last could no longer\nrefrain her, but drew nigh him and took his hands in hers, and kissed his\nmouth, and said as she caressed him:\n\n   \"O where are thy wounds, beloved? how turned the spear from thy\n   breast,\n   When the storm of war blew strongest, and the best men met the best?\n   Lo, this is the tale of to-day: but what shall to-morrow tell?\n   That Thiodolf the Mighty in the fight's beginning fell;\n   That there came a stroke ill-stricken, there came an aimless thrust,\n   And the life of the people's helper lay quenched in the summer dust.\"\n\nHe answered nothing, but smiled as though the sound of her voice and the\ntouch of her hand were pleasant to him, for so much love there was in\nher, that her very grief was scarcely grievous.  But she said again:\n\n   \"Thou sayest it: I am outcast; for a God that lacketh mirth\n   Hath no more place in God-home and never a place on earth.\n   A man grieves, and he gladdens, or he dies and his grief is gone;\n   But what of the grief of the Gods, and the sorrow never undone?\n   Yea verily I am the outcast.  When first in thine arms I lay\n   On the blossoms of the woodland my godhead passed away;\n   Thenceforth unto thee was I looking for the light and the glory of\n   life\n   And the Gods' doors shut behind me till the day of the uttermost\n   strife.\n   And now thou hast taken my soul, thou wilt cast it into the night,\n   And cover thine head with the darkness, and turn thine eyes from the\n   light.\n   Thou wouldst go to the empty country where never a seed is sown\n   And never a deed is fashioned, and the place where each is alone;\n   But I thy thrall shall follow, I shall come where thou seemest to lie,\n   I shall sit on the howe that hides thee, and thou so dear and nigh!\n   A few bones white in their war-gear that have no help or thought,\n   Shall be Thiodolf the Mighty, so nigh, so dear--and nought.\"\n\nHis hands strayed over her shoulders and arms, caressing them, and he\nsaid softly and lovingly:\n\n   \"I am Thiodolf the Mighty: but as wise as I may be\n   No story of that grave-night mine eyes can ever see,\n   But rather the tale of the Wolfings through the coming days of earth,\n   And the young men in their triumph and the maidens in their mirth;\n   And morn's promise every evening, and each day the promised morn,\n   And I amidst it ever reborn and yet reborn.\n   This tale I know, who have seen it, who have felt the joy and pain,\n   Each fleeing, each pursuing, like the links of the draw-well's chain:\n   But that deedless tide of the grave-mound, and the dayless nightless\n   day,\n   E'en as I strive to see it, its image wanes away.\n   What say'st thou of the grave-mound? shall I be there at all\n   When they lift the Horn of Remembrance, and the shout goes down the\n   hall,\n   And they drink the Mighty War-duke and Thiodolf the old?\n   Nay rather; there where the youngling that longeth to be bold\n   Sits gazing through the hall-reek and sees across the board\n   A vision of the reaping of the harvest of the sword,\n   There shall Thiodolf be sitting; e'en there shall the youngling be\n   That once in the ring of the hazels gave up his life to thee.\"\n\nShe laughed as he ended, and her voice was sweet, but bitter was her\nlaugh.  Then she said:\n\n   \"Nay thou shalt be dead, O warrior, thou shalt not see the Hall\n   Nor the children of thy people 'twixt the dais and the wall.\n   And I, and I shall be living; still on thee shall waste my thought:\n   I shall long and lack thy longing; I shall pine for what is nought.\"\n\nBut he smiled again, and said:\n\n   \"Not on earth shall I learn this wisdom; and how shall I learn it then\n   When I lie alone in the grave-mound, and have no speech with men?\n   But for thee,--O doubt it nothing that my life shall live in thee,\n   And so shall we twain be loving in the days that yet shall be.\"\n\nIt was as if she heard him not; and she fell aback from him a little and\nstood silently for a while as one in deep thought; and then turned and\nwent a few paces from him, and stooped down and came back again with\nsomething in her arms (and it was the hauberk once more), and said\nsuddenly:\n\n   \"O Thiodolf, now tell me for what cause thou wouldst not bear\n   This grey wall of the hammer in the tempest of the spear?\n   Didst thou doubt my faith, O Folk-wolf, or the counsel of the Gods,\n   That thou needs must cast thee naked midst the flashing battle-rods,\n   Or is thy pride so mighty that it seemed to thee indeed\n   That death was a better guerdon than the love of the Godhead's seed?\"\n\nBut Thiodolf said: \"O Wood-Sun, this thou hast a right to ask of me, why\nI have not worn in the battle thy gift, the Treasure of the World, the\nDwarf-wrought Hauberk!  And what is this that thou sayest?  I doubt not\nthy faith towards me and thine abundant love: and as for the rede of the\nGods, I know it not, nor may I know it, nor turn it this way nor that:\nand as for thy love and that I would choose death sooner, I know not what\nthou meanest; I will not say that I love thy love better than life\nitself; for these two, my life and my love, are blended together and may\nnot be sundered.\n\n\"Hearken therefore as to the Hauberk: I wot well that it is for no light\nmatter that thou wouldst have me bear thy gift, the wondrous hauberk,\ninto battle; I deem that some doom is wrapped up in it; maybe that I\nshall fall before the foe if I wear it not; and that if I wear it,\nsomewhat may betide me which is unmeet to betide a warrior of the\nWolfings.  Therefore will I tell thee why I have fought in two battles\nwith the Romans with unmailed body, and why I left the hauberk, (which I\nsee that thou bearest in thine arms) in the Roof of the Daylings.  For\nwhen I entered therein, clad in the hauberk, there came to meet me an\nancient man, one of the very valiant of days past, and he looked on me\nwith the eyes of love, as though he had been the very father of our folk,\nand I the man that was to come after him to carry on the life thereof.\nBut when he saw the hauberk and touched it, then was his love smitten\ncold with sadness and he spoke words of evil omen; so that putting this\ntogether with thy words about the gift, and that thou didst in a manner\ncompel me to wear it, I could not but deem that this mail is for the\nransom of a man and the ruin of a folk.\n\n\"Wilt thou say that it is not so? then will I wear the hauberk, and live\nand die happy.  But if thou sayest that I have deemed aright, and that a\ncurse goeth with the hauberk, then either for the sake of the folk I will\nnot wear the gift and the curse, and I shall die in great glory, and\nbecause of me the House shall live; or else for thy sake I shall bear it\nand live, and the House shall live or die as may be, but I not helping,\nnay I no longer of the House nor in it.  How sayest thou?\"\n\nThen she said:\n\n   \"Hail be thy mouth, beloved, for that last word of thine,\n   And the hope that thine heart conceiveth and the hope that is born in\n   mine.\n   Yea, for a man's delivrance was the hauberk born indeed\n   That once more the mighty warrior might help the folk at need.\n   And where is the curse's dwelling if thy life be saved to dwell\n   Amidst the Wolfing warriors and the folk that loves thee well\n   And the house where the high Gods left thee to be cherished well\n   therein?\n\n   \"Yea more: I have told thee, beloved, that thou art not of the kin;\n   The blood in thy body is blended of the wandering Elking race,\n   And one that I may not tell of, who in God-home hath his place,\n   And who changed his shape to beget thee in the wild-wood's leafy roof.\n   How then shall the doom of the Wolfings be woven in the woof\n   Which the Norns for thee have shuttled? or shall one man of war\n   Cast down the tree of the Wolfings on the roots that spread so far?\n   O friend, thou art wise and mighty, but other men have lived\n   Beneath the Wolfing roof-tree whereby the folk has thrived.\"\n\nHe reddened at her word; but his eyes looked eagerly on her.  She cast\ndown the hauberk, and drew one step nigher to him.  She knitted her\nbrows, her face waxed terrible, and her stature seemed to grow greater,\nas she lifted up her gleaming right arm, and cried out in a great voice.\n\n   \"Thou Thiodolf the Mighty!  Hadst thou will to cast the net\n   And tangle the House in thy trouble, it is I would slay thee yet;\n   For 'tis I and I that love them, and my sorrow would I give,\n   And thy life, thou God of battle, that the Wolfing House might live.\"\n\nTherewith she rushed forward, and cast herself upon him, and threw her\narms about him, and strained him to her bosom, and kissed his face, and\nhe her in likewise, for there was none to behold them, and nought but the\nnaked heaven was the roof above their heads.\n\nAnd now it was as if the touch of her face and her body, and the\nmurmuring of her voice changed and soft close to his ear, as she murmured\nmere words of love to him, drew him away from the life of deeds and\ndoubts and made a new world for him, wherein he beheld all those fair\npictures of the happy days that had been in his musings when first he\nleft the field of the dead.\n\nSo they sat down on the grey stone together hand in hand, her head laid\nupon his shoulder, no otherwise than if they had been two lovers, young\nand without renown in days of deep peace.\n\nSo as they sat, her foot smote on the cold hilts of the sword, which\nThiodolf had laid down in the grass; and she stooped and took it up, and\nlaid it across her knees and his as they sat there; and she looked on\nThrong-plough as he lay still in the sheath, and smiled on him, and saw\nthat the peace-strings were not yet wound about his hilts.  So she drew\nhim forth and raised him up in her hand, and he gleamed white and fearful\nin the growing dawn, for all things had now gotten their colours again,\nwhereas amidst their talking had the night worn, and the moon low down\nwas grown white and pale.\n\nBut she leaned aside, and laid her cheek against Thiodolf's, and he took\nthe sword out of her hand and set it on his knees again, and laid his\nright hand on it, and said:\n\n   \"Two things by these blue edges in the face of the dawning I swear;\n   And first this warrior's ransom in the coming fight to bear,\n   And evermore to love thee who hast given me second birth.\n   And by the sword I swear it, and by the Holy Earth,\n   To live for the House of the Wolfings, and at last to die for their\n   need.\n   For though I trow thy saying that I am not one of their seed,\n   Nor yet by the hand have been taken and unto the Father shown\n   As a very son of the Fathers, yet mid them hath my body grown;\n   And I am the guest of their Folk-Hall, and each one there is my\n   friend.\n   So with them is my joy and sorrow, and my life, and my death in the\n   end.\n   Now whatso doom hereafter my coming days shall bide,\n   Thou speech-friend, thou deliverer, thine is this dawning-tide.\"\n\nShe spoke no word to him; but they rose up and went hand in hand down the\ndale, he still bearing his naked sword over his shoulder, and thus they\nwent together into the yew-copse at the dale's end.  There they abode\ntill after the rising of the sun, and each to each spake many loving\nwords at their departure; and the Wood-Sun went her ways at her will.\n\nBut Thiodolf went up the dale again, and set Throng-plough in his sheath,\nand wound the peace-strings round him.  Then he took up the hauberk from\nthe grass whereas the Wood-Sun had cast it, and did it on him, as it were\nof the attire he was wont to carry daily.  So he girt Throng-plough to\nhim, and went soberly up to the ridge-top to the folk, who were just\nstirring in the early morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--TIDINGS BROUGHT TO THE WAIN-BURG\n\n\nNow it must be told of Otter and they of the Wain-burg how they had the\ntidings of the overthrow of the Romans on the Ridge, and that Egil had\nleft them on his way to Wolf-stead.  They were joyful of the tale, as was\nlike to be, but eager also to strike their stroke at the foemen, and in\nthat mood they abode fresh tidings.\n\nIt has been told how Otter had sent the Bearings and the Wormings to the\naid of Thiodolf and his folk, and these two were great kindreds, and they\nbeing gone, there abode with Otter, one man with another, thralls and\nfreemen, scant three thousand men: of these many were bowmen good to\nfight from behind a wall or fence, or some such cover, but scarce meet to\nwithstand a shock in the open field.  However it was deemed at this time\nin the Wain-burg that Thiodolf and his men would soon return to them; and\nin any case, they said, he lay between the Romans and the Mark, so that\nthey had but little doubt; or rather they feared that the Romans might\ndraw aback from the Mark before they could be met in battle again, for as\naforesaid they were eager for the fray.\n\nNow it was in the cool of the evening two days after the Battle on the\nRidge, that the men, both freemen and thralls, had been disporting\nthemselves in the plain ground without the Burg in casting the spear and\nputting the stone, and running races a-foot and a-horseback, and now\nclose on sunset three young men, two of the Laxings and one of the\nShieldings, and a grey old thrall of that same House, were shooting a\nmatch with the bow, driving their shafts at a rushen roundel hung on a\npole which the old thrall had dight.  Men were peaceful and happy, for\nthe time was fair and calm, and, as aforesaid, they dreaded not the Roman\nHost any more than if they were Gods dwelling in God-home.  The shooters\nwere deft men, and they of the Burg were curious to note their deftness,\nand many were breathed with the games wherein they had striven, and\nthought it good to rest, and look on the new sport: so they sat and stood\non the grass about the shooters on three sides, and the mead-horn went\nbriskly from man to man; for there was no lack of meat and drink in the\nBurg, whereas the kindreds that lay nighest to it had brought in abundant\nprovision, and women of the kindreds had come to them, and not a few were\nthere scattered up and down among the carles.\n\nNow the Shielding man, Geirbald by name, had just loosed at the mark, and\nhad shot straight and smitten the roundel in the midst, and a shout went\nup from the onlookers thereat; but that shout was, as it were, lined with\nanother, and a cry that a messenger was riding toward the Burg: thereat\nmost men looked round toward the wood, because their minds were set on\nfresh tidings from Thiodolf's company, but as it happened it was from the\nnorth and the side toward Mid-mark that they on the outside of the throng\nhad seen the rider coming; and presently the word went from man to man\nthat so it was, and that the new comer was a young man on a grey horse,\nand would speedily be amongst them; so they wondered what the tidings\nmight be, but yet they did not break up the throng, but abode in their\nplaces that they might receive the messenger more orderly; and as the\nrider drew near, those who were nighest to him perceived that it was a\nwoman.\n\nSo men made way before the grey horse, and its rider, and the horse was\nmuch spent and travel-worn.  So the woman rode right into the ring of\nwarriors, and drew rein there, and lighted down slowly and painfully, and\nwhen she was on the ground could scarce stand for stiffness; and two or\nthree of the swains drew near her to help her, and knew her at once for\nHrosshild of the Wolfings, for she was well-known as a doughty woman.\n\nThen she said: \"Bring me to Otter the War-duke; or bring him hither to\nme, which were best, since so many men are gathered together; and\nmeanwhile give me to drink; for I am thirsty and weary.\"\n\nSo while one went for Otter, another reached to her the mead-horn, and\nshe had scarce done her draught, ere Otter was there, for they had found\nhim at the gate of the Burg.  He had many a time been in the Wolfing\nHall, so he knew her at once and said:\n\n\"Hail, Hrosshild! how farest thou?\"\n\nShe said: \"I fare as the bearer of evil tidings.  Bid thy folk do on\ntheir war-gear and saddle their horses, and make no delay; for now\npresently shall the Roman host be in Mid-mark!\"\n\nThen cried Otter: \"Blow up the war-horn! get ye all to your weapons and\nbe ready to leap on your horses, and come ye to the Thing in good order\nkindred by kindred: later on ye shall hear Hrosshild's story as she shall\ntell it to me!\"\n\nTherewith he led her to a grassy knoll that was hard by, and set her down\nthereon and himself beside her, and said:\n\n\"Speak now, damsel, and fear not!  For now shall one fate go over us all,\neither to live together or die together as the free children of Tyr, and\nfriends of the Almighty God of the Earth.  How camest thou to meet the\nRomans and know of their ways and to live thereafter?\"\n\nShe said: \"Thus it was: the Hall-Sun bethought her how that the eastern\nways into Mid-mark that bring a man to the thicket behind the Roof of the\nBearings are nowise hard, even for an host; so she sent ten women, and me\nthe eleventh to the Bearing dwelling and the road through the thicket\naforesaid; and we were to take of the Bearing stay-at-homes whomso we\nwould that were handy, and then all we to watch the ways for fear of the\nRomans.  And methinks she has had some vision of their ways, though\nmayhap not altogether clear.\n\n\"Anyhow we came to the Bearing dwellings, and they gave us of their folk\neight doughty women and two light-foot lads, and so we were twenty and\none in all.\n\n\"So then we did as the Hall-Sun bade us, and ordained a chain of watchers\nfar up into the waste; and these were to sound a point of war upon their\nhorns each to each till the sound thereof should come to us who lay with\nour horses hoppled ready beside us in the fair plain of the Mark outside\nthe thicket.\n\n\"To be short, the horns waked us up in the midst of yesternight, and of\nthe watches also came to us the last, which had heard the sound amidst\nthe thicket, and said that it was certainly the sound of the Goths' horn,\nand the note agreed on.  Therefore I sent a messenger at once to the\nWolfing Roof to say what was toward; but to thee I would not ride until I\nhad made surer of the tidings; so I waited awhile, and then rode into the\nwild-wood; and a long tale I might make both of the waiting and the\nriding, had I time thereto; but this is the end of it; that going warily\na little past where the thicket thinneth and the road endeth, I came on\nthree of those watches or links in the chain we had made, and half of\nanother watch or link; that is to say six women, who were come together\nafter having blown their horns and fled (though they should rather have\nabided in some lurking-place to espy whatever might come that way) and\none other woman, who had been one of the watch much further off, and had\nspoken with the furthest of all, which one had seen the faring of the\nRoman Host, and that it was very great, and no mere band of pillagers or\nof scouts.  And, said this fleer (who was indeed half wild with fear),\nthat while they were talking together, came the Romans upon them, and saw\nthem; and a band of Romans beat the wood for them when they fled, and\nshe, the fleer, was at point to be taken, and saw two taken indeed, and\nhaled off by the Roman scourers of the wood.  But she escaped and so came\nto the others on the skirts of the thicket, having left of her skin and\nblood on many a thornbush and rock by the way.\n\n\"Now when I heard this, I bade this fleer get her home to the Bearings as\nswiftly as she might, and tell her tale; and she went away trembling, and\nscarce knowing whether her feet were on earth or on water or on fire; but\nbelike failed not to come there, as no Romans were before her.\n\n\"But for the others, I sent one to go straight to Wolf-stead on the heels\nof the first messenger, to tell the Hall-Sun what had befallen, and other\nfive I set to lurk in the thicket, whereas none could lightly lay hands\non them, and when they had new tidings, to flee to Wolf-stead as occasion\nmight serve them; and for myself I tarried not, but rode on the spur to\ntell thee hereof.\n\n\"But my last word to thee, Otter, is that by the Hall-sun's bidding the\nBearings will not abide fire and steel at their own stead, but when they\nhear true tidings of the Romans being hard at hand, will take with them\nall that is not too hot or too heavy to carry, and go their ways unto\nWolf-stead: and the tidings will go up and down the Mark on both sides of\nthe water, so that whatever is of avail for defence will gather there at\nour dwelling, and if we fall, goodly shall be the howe heaped over us,\neven if ye come not in time.\n\n\"Now have I told thee what I needs must and there is no need to question\nme more, for thou hast it all--do thou what thou hast to do!\"\n\nWith that word she cast herself down on the grass by the mound-side, and\nwas presently asleep, for she was very weary.\n\nBut all the time she had been telling her tale had the horn been\nsounding, and there were now a many warriors gathered and more coming in\nevery moment: so Otter stood up on the mound after he had bidden a man of\nhis House to bring him his horse and war-gear, and abided a little, till,\nas might be said, the whole host was gathered: then he bade cry silence,\nand spake:\n\n\"Sons of Tyr, now hath an Host of the Romans gotten into the Mark; a\nmighty host, but not so mighty that it may not be met.  Few words are\nbest: let the Steerings, who are not many, but are men well-tried in war\nand wisdom abide in the Burg along with the fighting thralls: but let the\nBurg be broken up and moved from the place, and let its warders wend\ntowards Mid-mark, but warily and without haste, and each night let them\nmake the wain-garth and keep good watch.\n\n\"But know ye that the Romans shall fall with all their power on the\nWolfing dwellings, deeming that when they have that, they shall have all\nthat is ours with ourselves also.  For there is the Hall-Sun under the\nGreat Roof, and there hath Thiodolf, our War-duke, his dwelling-place;\ntherefore shall all of us, save those that abide with the wains, take\nhorse, and ride without delay, and cross the water at Battleford, so that\nwe may fall upon the foe before they come west of the water; for as ye\nknow there is but one ford whereby a man wending straight from the\nBearings may cross Mirkwood-water, and it is like that the foe will tarry\nat the Bearing stead long enough to burn and pillage it.\n\n\"So do ye order yourselves according to your kindreds, and let the\nShieldings lead.  Make no more delay!  But for me I will now send a\nmessenger to Thiodolf to tell him of the tidings, and then speedily shall\nhe be with us.  Geirbald, I see thee; come hither!\"\n\nNow Geirbald stood amidst the Shieldings, and when Otter had spoken, he\ncame forth bestriding a white horse, and with his bow slung at his back.\nSaid Otter: \"Geirbald, thou shalt ride at once through the wood, and find\nThiodolf; and tell him the tidings, and that in nowise he follow the\nRoman fleers away from the Mark, nor to heed anything but the trail of\nthe foemen through the south-eastern heaths of Mirkwood, whether other\nRomans follow him or not: whatever happens let him lead the Goths by that\nroad, which for him is the shortest, towards the defence of the Wolfing\ndwellings.  Lo thou, my ring for a token!  Take it and depart in haste.\nYet first take thy fellow Viglund the Woodman with thee, lest if\nperchance one fall, the other may bear the message.  Tarry not, nor rest\ntill thy word be said!\"\n\nThen turned Geirbald to find Viglund who was anigh to him, and he took\nthe ring, and the twain went their ways without more ado, and rode into\nthe wild-wood.\n\nBut about the wain-burg was there plenteous stir of men till all was\nordered for the departure of the host, which was no long while, for there\nwas nothing to do but on with the war-gear and up on to the horse.\n\nForth then they went duly ordered in their kindreds towards the head of\nthe Upper-mark, riding as swiftly as they might without breaking their\narray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--THOSE MESSENGERS COME TO THIODOLF\n\n\nOf Geirbald and Viglund the tale tells that they rode the woodland paths\nas speedily as they might.  They had not gone far, and were winding\nthrough a path amidst of a thicket mingled of the hornbeam and holly,\nbetwixt the openings of which the bracken grew exceeding tall, when\nViglund, who was very fine-eared, deemed that he heard a horse coming to\nmeet them: so they lay as close as they might, and drew back their horses\nbehind a great holly-bush lest it should be some one or more of the foes\nwho had fled into the wood when the Romans were scattered in that first\nfight.  But as the sound drew nearer, and it was clearly the footsteps of\na great horse, they deemed it would be some messenger from Thiodolf, as\nindeed it turned out: for as the new-comer fared on, somewhat unwarily,\nthey saw a bright helm after the fashion of the Goths amidst of the\ntrees, and then presently they knew by his attire that he was of the\nBearings, and so at last they knew him to be Asbiorn of the said House, a\ndoughty man; so they came forth to meet him and he drew rein when he saw\narmed men, but presently beholding their faces he knew them and laughed\non them, and said:\n\n\"Hail fellows! what tidings are toward?\"\n\n\"These,\" said Viglund, \"that thou art well met, since now shalt thou turn\nback and bring us to Thiodolf as speedily as may be.\"\n\nBut Asbiorn laughed and said: \"Nay rather turn about with me; or why are\nye so grim of countenance?\"\n\n\"Our errand is no light one,\" said Geirbald, \"but thou, why art thou so\nmerry?\"\n\n\"I have seen the Romans fall,\" said he, \"and belike shall soon see more\nof that game: for I am on an errand to Otter from Thiodolf: the War-duke,\nwhen he had questioned some of those whom we took on the Day of the\nRidge, began to have a deeming that the Romans had beguiled us, and will\nfall on the Mark by the way of the south-east heaths: so now is he\nhastening to fetch a compass and follow that road either to overtake them\nor prevent them; and he biddeth Otter tarry not, but ride hard along the\nwater to meet them if he may, or ever they have set their hands to the\ndwellings of my House.  And belike when I have done mine errand to Otter\nI shall ride with him to look on these burners and slayers once more;\ntherefore am I merry.  Now for your tidings, fellows.\"\n\nSaid Geirbald: \"Our tidings are that both our errands are prevented, and\ncome to nought: for Otter hath not tarried, but hath ridden with all his\nfolk toward the stead of thine House.  So shalt thou indeed see these\nburners and slayers if thou ridest hard; since we have tidings that the\nRomans will by now be in Mid-mark.  And as for our errand, it is to bid\nThiodolf do even as he hath done.  Hereby may we see how good a pair of\nWar-dukes we have gotten, since each thinketh of the same wisdom.  Now\ntake we counsel together as to what we shall do; whether we shall go back\nto Otter with thee, or thou go back to Thiodolf with us; or else each go\nthe road ordained for us.\"\n\nSaid Asbiorn: \"To Otter will I ride as I was bidden, that I may look on\nthe burning of our roof, and avenge me of the Romans afterwards; and I\nbid you, fellows, ride with me, since fewer men there are with Otter, and\nhe must be the first to bide the brunt of battle.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Geirbald, \"as for me ye must even lose a man's aid; for to\nThiodolf was I sent, and to Thiodolf will I go: and bethink thee if this\nbe not best, since Thiodolf hath but a deeming of the ways of the Romans\nand we wot surely of them.  Our coming shall make him the speedier, and\nthe less like to turn back if any alien band shall follow after him.  What\nsayest thou, Viglund?\"\n\nSaid Viglund: \"Even as thou, Geirbald: but for myself I deem I may well\nturn back with Asbiorn.  For I would serve the House in battle as soon as\nmay be; and maybe we shall slaughter these kites of the cities, so that\nThiodolf shall have no work to do when he cometh.\"\n\nSaid Asbiorn; \"Geirbald, knowest thou right well the ways through the\nwood and on the other side thereof, to the place where Thiodolf abideth?\nfor ye see that night is at hand.\"\n\n\"Nay, not over well,\" said Geirbald.\n\nSaid Asbiorn: \"Then I rede thee take Viglund with thee; for he knoweth\nthem yard by yard, and where they be hard and where they be soft.\nMoreover it were best indeed that ye meet Thiodolf betimes; for I deem\nnot but that he wendeth leisurely, though always warily, because he\ndeemeth not that Otter will ride before to-morrow morning.  Hearken,\nViglund!  Thiodolf will rest to-night on the other side of the water,\nnigh to where the hills break off into the sheer cliffs that are called\nthe Kites' Nest, and the water runneth under them, coming from the east:\nand before him lieth the easy ground of the eastern heaths where he is\nminded to wend to-morrow betimes in the morning: and if ye do your best\nye shall be there before he is upon the road, and sure it is that your\ntidings shall hasten him.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest sooth,\" saith Geirbald, \"tarry we no longer; here sunder our\nways; farewell!\"\n\n\"Farewell,\" said he, \"and thou, Viglund, take this word in parting, that\nbelike thou shalt yet see the Romans, and strike a stroke, and maybe be\nsmitten.  For indeed they be most mighty warriors.\"\n\nThen made they no delay but rode their ways either side.  And Geirbald\nand Viglund rode over rough and smooth all night, and were out of the\nthick wood by day-dawn: and whereas they rode hard, and Viglund knew the\nways well, they came to Mirkwood-water before the day was old, and saw\nthat the host was stirring, but not yet on the way.  And or ever they\ncame to the water's edge, they were met by Wolfkettle of the Wolfings,\nand Hiarandi of the Elkings, and three others who were but just come from\nthe place where the hurt men lay down in a dale near the Great Ridge;\nthere had Wolfkettle and Hiarandi been tending Toti of the Beamings,\ntheir fellow-in-arms, who had been sorely hurt in the battle, but was\ndoing well, and was like to live.  So when they saw the messengers, they\ncame up to them and hailed them, and asked them if the tidings were good\nor evil.\n\n\"That is as it may be,\" said Geirbald, \"but they are short to tell; the\nRomans are in Mid-mark, and Otter rideth on the spur to meet them, and\nsendeth us to bid Thiodolf wend the heaths to fall in on them also.  Nor\nmay we tarry one minute ere we have seen Thiodolf.\"\n\nSaid Wolfkettle, \"We will lead you to him; he is on the east side of the\nwater, with all his host, and they are hard on departing.\"\n\nSo they went down the ford, which was not very deep; and Wolfkettle rode\nthe ford behind Geirbald, and another man behind Viglund; but Hiarandi\nwent afoot with the others beside the horses, for he was a very tall man.\n\nBut as they rode amidst the clear water Wolfkettle lifted up his voice\nand sang:\n\n   \"White horse, with what are ye laden as ye wade the shallows warm,\n   But with tidings of the battle, and the fear of the fateful storm?\n   What loureth now behind us, what pileth clouds before,\n   On either hand what gathereth save the stormy tide of war?\n   Now grows midsummer mirky, and fallow falls the morn,\n   And dusketh the Moon's Sister, and the trees look overworn;\n   God's Ash tree shakes and shivers, and the sheer cliff standeth white\n   As the bones of the giants' father when the Gods first fared to\n   fight.\"\n\nAnd indeed the morning had grown mirky and grey and threatening, and from\nfar away the thunder growled, and the face of the Kite's Nest showed pale\nand awful against a dark steely cloud; and a few drops of rain pattered\ninto the smooth water before them from a rag of the cloud-flock right\nover head.  They were in mid stream now, for the water was wide there; on\nthe eastern bank were the warriors gathering, for they had beheld the\nfaring of those men, and the voice of Wolfkettle came to them across the\nwater, so they deemed that great tidings were toward, and would fain know\non what errand those were come.\n\nThen the waters of the ford deepened till Hiarandi was wading more than\nwaist-deep, and the water flowed over Geirbald's saddle; then Wolfkettle\nlaughed, and turning as he sat, dragged out his sword, and waved it from\neast to west and sang:\n\n   \"O sun, pale up in heaven, shrink from us if thou wilt,\n   And turn thy face from beholding the shock of guilt with guilt!\n   Stand still, O blood of summer! and let the harvest fade,\n   Till there be nought but fallow where once was bloom and blade!\n   O day, give out but a glimmer of all thy flood of light,\n   If it be but enough for our eyen to see the road of fight!\n   Forget all else and slumber, if still ye let us wake,\n   And our mouths shall make the thunder, and our swords shall the\n   lightening make,\n   And we shall be the storm-wind and drive the ruddy rain,\n   Till the joy of our hearts in battle bring back the day again.\"\n\nAs he spake that word they came up through the shallow water dripping on\nto the bank, and they and the men who abode them on the bank shouted\ntogether for joy of fellowship, and all tossed aloft their weapons.  The\nman who had ridden behind Viglund slipped off on to the ground; but\nWolfkettle abode in his place behind Geirbald.\n\nSo the messengers passed on, and the others closed up round about them,\nand all the throng went up to where Thiodolf was sitting on a rock\nbeneath a sole ash-tree, the face of the Kite's Nest rising behind him on\nthe other side of a bight of the river.  There he sat unhelmed with the\ndwarf-wrought hauberk about him, holding Throng-plough in its sheath\nacross his knees, while he gave word to this and that man concerning the\norder of the host.\n\nSo when they were come thither, the throng opened that the messengers\nmight come forward; for by this time had many more drawn near to hearken\nwhat was toward.  There they sat on their horses, the white and the grey,\nand Wolfkettle stood by Geirbald's bridle rein, for he had now lighted\ndown; and a little behind him, his head towering over the others, stood\nHiarandi great and gaunt.  The ragged cloud had drifted down south-east\nnow and the rain fell no more, but the sun was still pale and clouded.\n\nThen Thiodolf looked gravely on them, and spake:\n\n   \"What do ye sons of the War-shield? what tale is there to tell?\n   Is the kindred fallen tangled in the grasp of the fallow Hell?\n   Crows the red cock over the homesteads, have we met the foe too late?\n   For meseems your brows are heavy with the shadowing o'er of fate.\"\n\nBut Geirbald answered:\n\n   \"Still cold with dew in the morning the Shielding Roof-ridge stands,\n   Nor yet hath grey Hell bounden the Shielding warriors' hands;\n   But lo, the swords, O War-duke, how thick in the wind they shake,\n   Because we bear the message that the battle-road ye take,\n   Nor tarry for the thunder or the coming on of rain,\n   Or the windy cloudy night-tide, lest your battle be but vain.\n   And this is the word that Otter yestre'en hath set in my mouth;\n   Seek thou the trail of the Aliens of the Cities of the South,\n   And thou shalt find it leading o'er the heaths to the beechen-wood,\n   And thence to the stony places where the foxes find their food;\n   And thence to the tangled thicket where the folkway cleaves it\n   through,\n   To the eastern edge of Mid-mark where the Bearings deal and do.\"\n\nThen said Thiodolf in a cold voice, \"What then hath befallen Otter?\"\n\nSaid Geirbald:\n\n   \"When last I looked upon Otter, all armed he rode the plain,\n   With his whole host clattering round him like the rush of the summer\n   rain;\n   To the right or the left they looked not but they rode through the\n   dusk and the dark\n   Beholding nought before them but the dream of the foes in the Mark.\n   So he went; but his word fled from him and on my horse it rode,\n   And again it saith, O War-duke seek thou the Bear's abode,\n   And tarry never a moment for ought that seems of worth,\n   For there shall ye find the sword-edge and the flame of the foes of\n   the earth.\n\n\"Tarry not, Thiodolf, nor turn aback though a new foe followeth on thine\nheels.  No need to question me more; I have no more to tell, save that a\nwoman brought these tidings to us, whom the Hall-Sun had sent with others\nto watch the ways: and some of them had seen the Romans, who are a great\nhost and no band stealing forth to lift the herds.\"\n\nNow all those round about him heard his words, for he spake with a loud\nvoice; and they knew what the bidding of the War-duke would be; so they\nloitered not, but each man went about his business of looking to his war-\ngear and gathering to the appointed place of his kindred.  And even while\nGeirbald had been speaking, had Hiarandi brought up the man who bore the\ngreat horn, who when Thiodolf leapt to his feet to find him, was close at\nhand.  So he bade him blow the war-blast, and all men knew the meaning of\nthat voice of the horn, and every man armed him in haste, and they who\nhad horses (and these were but the Bearings and the Warnings), saddled\nthem, and mounted, and from mouth to mouth went the word that the Romans\nwere gotten into Mid-mark, and were burning the Bearing abodes.  So\nspeedily was the whole host ready for the way, the Wolfings at the head\nof all.  Then came forth Thiodolf from the midst of his kindred, and they\nraised him upon a great war-shield upheld by many men, and he stood\nthereon and spake:\n\n   \"O sons of Tyr, ye have vanquished, and sore hath been your pain;\n   But he that smiteth in battle must ever smite again;\n   And thus with you it fareth, and the day abideth yet\n   When ye shall hold the Aliens as the fishes in the net.\n   On the Ridge ye slew a many; but there came a many more\n   From their strongholds by the water to their new-built garth of war,\n   And all these have been led by dastards o'er the way our feet must\n   tread\n   Through the eastern heaths and the beech-wood to the door of the\n   Bearing stead,\n   Now e'en yesterday I deemed it, but I durst not haste away\n   Ere the word was borne to Otter and 'tis he bids haste to-day;\n   So now by day and by night-tide it behoveth us to wend\n   And wind the reel of battle and weave its web to end.\n   Had ye deemed my eyes foreseeing, I would tell you of my sight,\n   How I see the folk delivered and the Aliens turned to flight,\n   While my own feet wend them onwards to the ancient Father's Home.\n   But belike these are but the visions that to many a man shall come\n   When he goeth adown to the battle, and before him riseth high\n   The wall of valiant foemen to hide all things anigh.\n   But indeed I know full surely that no work that we may win\n   To-morrow or the next day shall quench the Markmen's kin.\n   On many a day hereafter shall their warriors carry shield;\n   On many a day their maidens shall drive the kine afield,\n   On many a day their reapers bear sickle in the wheat\n   When the golden wind-wrought ripple stirs round the feast-hall's feet.\n   Lo, now is the day's work easy--to live and overcome,\n   Or to die and yet to conquer on the threshold of the Home.\"\n\nAnd therewith he gat him down and went a-foot to the head of the Wolfing\nband, a great shout going with him, which was mingled with the voice of\nthe war-horn that bade away.\n\nSo fell the whole host into due array, and they were somewhat over three\nthousand warriors, all good and tried men and meet to face the uttermost\nof battle in the open field; so they went their ways with all the speed\nthat footmen may, and in fair order; and the sky cleared above their\nheads, but the distant thunder still growled about the world.  Geirbald\nand Viglund joined themselves to the Wolfings and went a-foot along with\nWolfkettle; but Hiarandi went with his kindred who were second in the\narray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX--OTTER AND HIS FOLK COME INTO MID-MARK\n\n\nOtter and his folk rode their ways along Mirkwood-water, and made no\nstay, except now and again to breathe their horses, till they came to\nBattleford in the early morning; there they baited their horses, for the\ngrass was good in the meadow, and the water easy to come at.\n\nSo after they had rested there a short hour, and had eaten what was easy\nfor them to get, they crossed the ford, and wended along Mirkwood-water\nbetween the wood and the river, but went slower than before lest they\nshould weary their horses; so that it was high-noon before they had come\nout of the woodland way into Mid-mark; and at once as soon as the whole\nplain of the Mark opened out before them, they saw what most of them\nlooked to see (since none doubted Hrosshild's tale), and that was a\ncolumn of smoke rising high and straight up into the air, for the\nafternoon was hot and windless.  Great wrath rose in their hearts\nthereat, and many a strong man trembled for anger, though none for fear,\nas Otter raised his right hand and stretched it out towards that token of\nwrack and ruin; yet they made no stay, nor did they quicken their pace\nmuch; because they knew that they should come to Bearham before night-\nfall, and they would not meet the Romans way-worn and haggard; but they\nrode on steadily, a terrible company of wrathful men.\n\nThey passed by the dwellings of the kindreds, though save for the\nGaltings the houses on the east side of the water between the Bearings\nand the wild-wood road were but small; for the thicket came somewhat near\nto the water and pinched the meadows.  But the Galtings were great\nhunters and trackers of the wild-wood, and they of the Geddings, the\nErings and the Withings, which were smaller Houses, lived somewhat on the\ntake of fish from Mirkwood-water (as did the Laxings also of the Nether-\nmark), for thereabout were there goodly pools and eddies, and sun-warmed\nshallows therewithal for the spawning of the trouts; as there were eyots\nin the water, most of which tailed off into a gravelly shallow at their\nlower ends.\n\nNow as the riders of the Goths came over against the dwellings of the\nWithings, they saw people, mostly women, driving up the beasts from the\nmeadow towards the garth; but upon the tofts about their dwellings were\ngathered many folk, who had their eyes turned toward the token of ravage\nthat hung in the sky above the fair plain; but when these beheld the\nriding of the host, they tossed up their arms to them and whatever they\nbore in them, and the sound of their shrill cry (for they were all women\nand young lads) came down the wind to the ears of the riders.  But down\nby the river on a swell of the ground were some swains and a few thralls,\nand among them some men armed and a-horseback; and these, when they\nperceived the host coming on turned and rode to meet them; and as they\ndrew near they shouted as men overjoyed to meet their kindred; and indeed\nthe fighting-men of their own House were riding in the host.  And the\narmed men were three old men, and one very old with marvellous long white\nhair, and four long lads of some fifteen winters, and four stout carles\nof the thralls bearing bows and bucklers, and these rode behind the\nswains; so they found their own kindred and rode amongst them.\n\nBut when they were all jingling and clashing on together, the dust\narising from the sun-dried turf, the earth shaking with the thunder of\nthe horse-hoofs, then the heart of the long-hoary one stirred within him\nas he bethought him of the days of his youth, and to his old nostrils\ncame the smell of the horses and the savour of the sweat of warriors\nriding close together knee to knee adown the meadow.  So he lifted up his\nvoice and sang:\n\n      \"Rideth lovely along\n      The strong by the strong;\n      Soft under his breath\n      Singeth sword in the sheath,\n      And shield babbleth oft\n      Unto helm-crest aloft;\n   How soon shall their words rise mid wrath of the battle\n   Into wrangle unheeded of clanging and rattle,\n   And no man shall note then the gold on the sword\n   When the runes have no meaning, the mouth-cry no word,\n   When all mingled together, the war-sea of men\n   Shall toss up the steel-spray round fourscore and ten.\n\n      \"Now as maids burn the weed\n      Betwixt acre and mead,\n      So the Bearings' Roof\n      Burneth little aloof,\n      And red gloweth the hall\n      Betwixt wall and fair wall,\n   Where often the mead-sea we sipped in old days,\n   When our feet were a-weary with wending the ways;\n   When the love of the lovely at even was born,\n   And our hands felt fair hands as they fell on the horn.\n   There round about standeth the ring of the foe\n   Tossing babes on their spears like the weeds o'er the low.\n\n      \"Ride, ride then! nor spare\n      The red steeds as ye fare!\n      Yet if daylight shall fail,\n      By the fire-light of bale\n      Shall we see the bleared eyes\n      Of the war-learned, the wise.\n   In the acre of battle the work is to win,\n   Let us live by the labour, sheaf-smiting therein;\n   And as oft o'er the sickle we sang in time past\n   When the crake that long mocked us fled light at the last,\n   So sing o'er the sword, and the sword-hardened hand\n   Bearing down to the reaping the wrath of the land.\"\n\nSo he sang; and a great shout went up from his kindred and those around\nhim, and it was taken up all along the host, though many knew not why\nthey shouted, and the whole host quickened its pace, and went a great\ntrot over the smooth meadow.\n\nSo in no long while were they come over against the stead of the Erings,\nand thereabouts were no beasts afield, and no women, for all the neat\nwere driven into the garth of the House; but all they who were not war-\nfit were standing without doors looking down the Mark towards the reek of\nthe Bearing dwellings, and these also sent a cry of welcome toward the\nhost of their kindred.  But along the river-bank came to meet the host an\narmed band of two old men, two youths who were their sons, and twelve\nthralls who were armed with long spears; and all these were a-horseback:\nso they fell in with their kindred and the host made no stay for them,\nbut pressed on over-running the meadow.  And still went up that column of\nsmoke, and thicker and blacker it grew a-top, and ruddier amidmost.\n\nSo came they by the abode of the Geddings, and there also the neat and\nsheep were close in the home-garth: but armed men were lying or standing\nabout the river bank, talking or singing merrily none otherwise than\nthough deep peace were on the land; and when they saw the faring of the\nhost they sprang to their feet with a shout and gat to their horses at\nonce: they were more than the other bands had been, for the Geddings were\na greater House; they were seven old men, and ten swains, and ten thralls\nbearing long spears like to those of the Erings; and no sooner had they\nfallen in with their kindred, than the men of the host espied a greater\ncompany yet coming to meet them: and these were of the folk of the\nGaltings; and amongst them were ten warriors in their prime, because they\nhad but of late come back from the hunting in the wood and had been\nbelated from the muster of the kindreds; and with them were eight old men\nand fifteen lads, and eighteen thralls; and the swains and thralls all\nbore bows besides the swords that they were girt withal, and not all of\nthem had horses, but they who had none rode behind the others: so they\njoined themselves to the host, shouting aloud; and they had with them a\ngreat horn that they blew on till they had taken their place in the\narray; and whereas their kindred was with Thiodolf, they followed along\nwith the hinder men of the Shieldings.\n\nSo now all the host went on together, and when they had passed the\nGalting abodes, there was nothing between them and Bearham, nor need they\nlook for any further help of men; there were no beasts afield nor any to\nherd them, and the stay-at-homes were within doors dighting them for\ndeparture into the wild-wood if need should be: but a little while after\nthey had passed these dwellings came into the host two swains of about\ntwenty winters, and a doughty maid, their sister, and they bare no\nweapons save short spears and knives; they were wet and dripping with the\nwater, for they had just swum Mirkwood-water.  They were of the Wolfing\nHouse, and had been shepherding a few sheep on the west side of the\nwater, when they saw the host faring to battle, and might not refrain\nthem, but swam their horses across the swift deeps to join their kindred\nto live and die with them.  The tale tells that they three fought in the\nbattles that followed after, and were not slain there, though they\nentered them unarmed, but lived long years afterwards: of them need no\nmore be said.\n\nNow, when the host was but a little past the Galting dwellings men began\nto see the flames mingled with the smoke of the burning, and the smoke\nitself growing thinner, as though the fire had over-mastered everything\nand was consuming itself with its own violence; and somewhat afterwards,\nthe ground rising, they could see the Bearing meadow and the foemen\nthereon: yet a little further, and from the height of another swelling of\nthe earth they could see the burning houses themselves and the array of\nthe Romans; so there they stayed and breathed their horses a while.  And\nthey beheld how of the Romans a great company was gathered together in\nclose array betwixt the ford and the Bearing Hall, but nigher unto the\nford, and these were a short mile from them; but others they saw\nstreaming out from the burning dwellings, as if their work were done\nthere, and they could not see that they had any captives with them.  Other\nRomans there were, and amongst them men in the attire of the Goths,\nbusied about the river banks, as though they were going to try the ford.\n\nBut a little while abode Otter in that place, and then waved his arm and\nrode on and all the host followed; and as they drew nigher, Otter, who\nwas wise in war, beheld the Romans and deemed them a great host, and the\nvery kernel and main body of them many more than all his company; and\nmoreover they were duly and well arrayed as men waiting a foe; so he knew\nthat he must be wary or he would lose himself and all his men.\n\nSo he stayed his company when they were about two furlongs from them, and\nthe main body of the foe stirred not, but horsemen and slingers came\nforth from its sides and made on toward the Goths, and in three or four\nminutes were within bowshot of them.  Then the bowmen of the Goths\nslipped down from their horses and bent their bows and nocked their\narrows and let fly, and slew and hurt many of the horsemen, who endured\ntheir shot but for a minute or two and then turned rein and rode back\nslowly to their folk, and the slingers came not on very eagerly whereas\nthey were dealing with men a-horseback, and the bowmen of the Goths also\nheld them still.\n\nNow turned Otter to his folk and made them a sign, which they knew well,\nthat they should get down from their horses; and when they were afoot the\nleaders of tens and hundreds arrayed them, into the wedge-array, with the\nbowmen on either flank: and Otter smiled as he beheld this adoing and\nthat the Romans meddled not with them, belike because they looked to have\nthem good cheap, since they were but a few wild men.\n\nBut when they were all arrayed he sat still on his horse and spake to\nthem short and sharply, saying:\n\n\"Men of the Goths, will ye mount your horses again and ride into the wood\nand let it cover you, or will ye fight these Romans?\"  They answered him\nwith a great shout and the clashing of their weapons on their shields.\n\"That is well,\" quoth Otter, \"since we have come so far; for I perceive\nthat the foe will come to meet us, so that we must either abide their\nshock or turn our backs.  Yet must we fight wisely or we are undone, and\nThiodolf in risk of undoing; this have we to do if we may, to thrust in\nbetween them and the ford, and if we may do that, there let us fight it\nout, till we fall one over another.  But if we may not do it, then will\nwe not throw our lives away but do the foemen what hurt we may without\nmingling ourselves amongst them, and so abide the coming of Thiodolf; for\nif we get not betwixt them and the ford we may in no case hinder them\nfrom crossing.  And all this I tell you that ye may follow me wisely, and\nrefrain your wrath that ye may live yet to give it the rein when the time\ncomes.\"\n\nSo he spake and got down from his horse and drew his sword and went to\nthe head of the wedge-array and began slowly to lead forth; but the\nthralls and swains had heed of the horses, and they drew aback with them\ntowards the wood which was but a little way from them.\n\nBut for Otter he led his men down towards the ford, and when the Romans\nsaw that, their main body began to move forward, faring slant-wise, as a\ncrab, down toward the ford; then Otter hastened somewhat, as he well\nmight, since his men were well learned in war and did not break their\narray; but now by this time were those burners of the Romans come up with\nthe main battle, and the Roman captain sent them at once against the\nGoths, and they advanced boldly enough, a great cloud of men in loose\narray who fell to with arrows and slings on the wedge-array and slew and\nhurt many: yet did not Otter stay his folk; but it was ill going for\nthem, for their unshielded sides were turned to the Romans, nor durst\nOtter scatter his bowmen out from the wedge-array, lest the Romans, who\nwere more than they, should enter in amongst them.  Ever he gazed\nearnestly on the main battle of the Romans, and what they were doing, and\npresently it became clear to him that they would outgo him and come to\nthe ford, and then he wotted well that they would set on him just when\ntheir light-armed were on his flank and his rearward, and then it would\ngo hard but they would break their array and all would be lost: therefore\nhe slacked his pace and went very slowly and the Romans went none the\nslower for that; but their light-armed grew bolder and drew more together\nas they came nigher to the Goths, as though they would give them an\nonset; but just at that nick of time Otter passed the word down the\nranks, and, waving his sword, turned sharply to the right and fell with\nall the wedge-array on the clustering throng of the light-armed, and his\nbowmen spread out now from the right flank of the wedge-array, and shot\nsharp and swift and the bowmen on the left flank ran forward swiftly till\nthey had cleared the wedge-array and were on the flank of the light-armed\nRomans; and they, what between the onset of the swordsmen and spearmen of\nthe Goths, and their sharp arrows, knew not which way to turn, and a\ngreat slaughter befell amongst them, and they of them were the happiest\nwho might save themselves by their feet.\n\nNow after this storm, and after these men had been thrust away, Otter\nstayed not, but swept round about the field toward the horses; and indeed\nhe looked to it that the main-battle of the Romans should follow him, but\nthey did not, but stayed still to receive the fleers of their\nlight-armed.  And this indeed was the goodhap of the Goths; for they were\nsomewhat disordered by their chase of the light-armed, and they smote and\nspared not, their hearts being full of bitter wrath, as might well be;\nfor even as they turned on the Romans, they beheld the great roof of the\nBearings fall in over the burned hall, and a great shower of sparks burst\nup from its fall, and there were the ragged gables left standing, licked\nby little tongues of flame which could not take hold of them because of\nthe clay which filled the spaces between the great timbers and was daubed\nover them.  And they saw that all the other houses were either alight or\nsmouldering, down to the smallest cot of a thrall, and even the barns and\nbooths both great and little.\n\nTherefore, whereas the Markmen were far fewer in all than the Roman main-\nbattle, and whereas this same host was in very good array, no doubt there\nwas that the Markmen would have been grievously handled had the Romans\nfallen on; but the Roman Captain would not have it so: for though he was\na bold man, yet was his boldness that of the wolf, that falleth on when\nhe is hungry and skulketh when he is full.  He was both young and very\nrich, and a mighty man among his townsmen, and well had he learned that\nginger is hot in the mouth, and though he had come forth to the war for\nthe increasing of his fame, he had no will to die among the Markmen,\neither for the sake of the city of Rome, or of any folk whatsoever, but\nwas liefer to live for his own sake.  Therefore was he come out to\nvanquish easily, that by his fame won he might win more riches and\ndominion in Rome; and he was well content also to have for his own\nwhatever was choice amongst the plunder of these wild-men (as he deemed\nthem), if it were but a fair woman or two.  So this man thought, It is my\nbusiness to cross the ford and come to Wolfstead, and there take the\ntreasure of the tribe, and have a stronghold there, whence we may slay so\nmany of these beasts with little loss to us that we may march away easily\nand with our hands full, even if Maenius with his men come not to our\naid, as full surely he will: therefore as to these angry men, who be not\nwithout might and conduct in battle, let us remember the old saw that\nsaith 'a bridge of gold to a fleeing foe,' and let them depart with no\nmore hurt of Romans, and seek us afterwards when we are fenced into their\nstead, which shall then be our stronghold: even so spake he to his\nCaptains about him.\n\nFor it must be told that he had no tidings of the overthrow of the Romans\non the Ridge; nor did he know surely how many fighting-men the Markmen\nmight muster, except by the report of those dastards of the Goths; and\nthough he had taken those two women in the wastes, yet had he got no word\nfrom them, for they did as the Hall-Sun bade them, when they knew that\nthey would be questioned with torments, and smiting themselves each with\na little sharp knife, so went their ways to the Gods.\n\nThus then the Roman Captain let the Markmen go their ways, and turned\ntoward the ford, and the Markmen went slowly now toward their horses.\nHowbeit there were many of them who murmured against Otter, saying that\nit was ill done to have come so far and ridden so hard, and then to have\ndone so little, and that were to-morrow come, they would not be led away\nso easily: but now they said it was ill; for the Romans would cross the\nwater, and make their ways to Wolfstead, none hindering them, and would\nburn the dwellings and slay the old men and thralls, and have away the\nwomen and children and the Hall-Sun the treasure of the Markmen.  In\nsooth, they knew not that a band of the Roman light-armed had already\ncrossed the water, and had fallen upon the dwellings of the Wolfings; but\nthat the old men and younglings and thralls of the House had come upon\nthem as they were entangled amidst the tofts and the garths, and had\novercome them and slain many.\n\nThus went Otter and his men to their horses when it was now drawing\ntoward sunset (for all this was some while adoing), and betook them to a\nrising ground not far from the wood-side, and there made what sort of a\ngarth they might, with their horses and the limbs of trees and\nlong-shafted spears; and they set a watch and abode in the garth right\nwarily, and lighted no fires when night fell, but ate what meat they had\nwith them, which was but little, and so sleeping and watching abode the\nmorning.  But the main body of the Romans did not cross the ford that\nnight, for they feared lest they might go astray therein, for it was an\nill ford to those that knew not the water: so they abode on the bank nigh\nto the water's edge, with the mind to cross as soon as it was fairly\ndaylight.\n\nNow Otter had lost of his men some hundred and twenty slain or grievously\nhurt, and they had away with them the hurt men and the bodies of the\nslain.  The tale tells not how many of the Romans were slain, but a many\nof their light-armed had fallen, since the Markmen had turned so hastily\nupon them, and they had with them many of the best bowmen of the Mark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--THEY BICKER ABOUT THE FORD\n\n\nIn the grey of the morning was Otter afoot with the watchers, and\npresently he got on his horse and peered over the plain, but the mist yet\nhung low on it, so that he might see nought for a while; but at last he\nseemed to note something coming toward the host from the upper water\nabove the ford, so he rode forward to meet it, and lo, it was a lad of\nfifteen winters, naked save his breeches, and wet from the river; and\nOtter drew rein, and the lad said to him: \"Art thou the War-duke?\"  \"Yea,\"\nsaid Otter.\n\nSaid the lad, \"I am Ali, the son of Grey, and the Hall-Sun hath sent me\nto thee with this word: 'Are ye coming?  Is Thiodolf at hand?  For I have\nseen the Roof-ridge red in the sunlight as if it were painted with\ncinnabar.'\"\n\nSaid Otter, \"Art thou going back to Wolfstead, son?\"\n\n\"Yea, at once, my father,\" said Ali.\n\n\"Then tell her,\" said Otter, \"that Thiodolf is at hand, and when he\ncometh we shall both together fall upon the Romans either in crossing the\nford or in the Wolfing meadow; but tell her also that I am not strong\nenough to hinder the Romans from crossing.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Ali, \"the Hall-Sun saith: Thou art wise in war; now tell\nus, shall we hold the Hall against the Romans that ye may find us there?\nFor we have discomfited their vanguard already, and we have folk who can\nfight; but belike the main battle of the Romans shall get the upper hand\nof us ere ye come to our helping: belike it were better to leave the\nhall, and let the wood cover us.\"\n\n\"Now is this well asked,\" said Otter; \"get thee back, my son, and bid the\nHall-Sun trust not to warding of the Hall, for the Romans are a mighty\nhost: and this day, even when Thiodolf cometh hither, shall be hard for\nthe Goth-folk: let her hasten lest these thieves come upon her hastily;\nlet her take the Hall-Sun her namesake, and the old men and children and\nthe women, and let those fighting folk she hath be a guard to all this in\nthe wood.  And hearken moreover; it will, maybe, be six hours ere\nThiodolf cometh; tell her I will cast the dice for life or death, and\nstir up these Romans now at once, that they may have other things to\nthink of than burning old men and women and children in their dwellings;\nthus may she reach the wood unhindered.  Hast thou all this in thine\nhead?  Then go thy ways.\"\n\nBut the lad lingered, and he reddened and looked on the ground and then\nhe said: \"My father, I swam the deeps, and when I reached this bank, I\ncrept along by the mist and the reeds toward where the Romans are, and I\ncame near to them, and noted what they were doing; and I tell thee that\nthey are already stirring to take the water at the ford.  Now then do\nwhat thou wilt.\"\n\nTherewith he turned about, and went his way at once, running like a colt\nwhich has never felt halter or bit.\n\nBut Otter rode back hastily and roused certain men in whom he trusted,\nand bid them rouse the captains and all the host and bid men get to horse\nspeedily and with as little noise as might be.  So did they, and there\nwas little delay, for men were sleeping with one eye open, as folk say,\nand many were already astir.  So in a little while they were all in the\nsaddle, and the mist yet stretched low over the meadow; for the morning\nwas cool and without wind.  Then Otter bade the word be carried down the\nranks that they should ride as quietly as may be and fare through the\nmist to do the Romans some hurt, but in nowise to get entangled in their\nranks, and all men to heed well the signal of turning and drawing aback;\nand therewith they rode off down the meadow led by men who could have led\nthem through the dark night.\n\nBut for the Romans, they were indeed getting ready to cross the ford when\nthe mist should have risen; and on the bank it was thinning already and\nmelting away; for a little air of wind was beginning to breathe from the\nnorth-east and the sunrise, which was just at hand; and the bank,\nmoreover, was stonier and higher than the meadow's face, which fell away\nfrom it as a shallow dish from its rim: thereon yet lay the mist like a\nwhite wall.\n\nSo the Romans and their friends the dastards of the Goths had well nigh\ngot all ready, and had driven stakes into the water from bank to bank to\nmark out the safe ford, and some of their light-armed and most of their\nGoths were by now in the water or up on the Wolfing meadow with the more\npart of their baggage and wains; and the rest of the host was drawn up in\ngood order, band by band, waiting the word to take the water, and the\ncaptain was standing nigh to the river bank beside their God the chief\nbanner of the Host.\n\nOf a sudden one of the dastards of the Goths who was close to the Captain\ncried out that he heard horse coming; but because he spake in the Gothic\ntongue, few heeded; but even therewith an old leader of a hundred cried\nout the same tidings in the Roman tongue, and all men fell to handling\ntheir weapons; but before they could face duly toward the meadow, came\nrushing from out of the mist a storm of shafts that smote many men, and\ntherewithal burst forth the sound of the Markmen's war-horn, like the\nroaring of a hundred bulls mingled with the thunder of horses at the\ngallop; and then dark over the wall of mist showed the crests of the\nriders of the Mark, though scarce were their horses seen till their whole\nwar-rank came dark and glittering into the space of the rising-ground\nwhere the mist was but a haze now, and now at last smitten athwart by the\nlow sun just arisen.\n\nTherewith came another storm of shafts, wherein javelins and spears cast\nby the hand were mingled with the arrows: but the Roman ranks had faced\nthe meadow and the storm which it yielded, swiftly and steadily, and they\nstood fast and threw their spears, albeit not with such good aim as might\nhave been, because of their haste, so that few were slain by them.  And\nthe Roman Captain still loth to fight with the Goths in earnest for no\nreward, and still more and more believing that this was the only band of\nthem that he had to look to, bade those who were nighest the ford not to\ntarry for the onset of a few wild riders, but to go their ways into the\nwater; else by a sudden onrush might the Romans have entangled Otter's\nband in their ranks, and so destroyed all.  As it was the horsemen fell\nnot on the Roman ranks full in face, but passing like a storm athwart the\nranks to the right, fell on there where they were in thinnest array (for\nthey were gathered to the ford as aforesaid), and slew some and drave\nsome into the deeps and troubled the whole Roman host.\n\nSo now the Roman Captain was forced to take new order, and gather all his\nmen together, and array his men for a hard fight; and by now the mist was\nrolling off from the face of the whole meadow and the sun was bright and\nhot.  His men serried their ranks, and the front rank cast their spears,\nand slew both men and horses of the Goths as those rode along their front\ncasting their javelins, and shooting here and there from behind their\nhorses if occasion served, or making a shift to send an arrow even as\nthey sat a-horseback; then the second rank of the Romans would take the\nplace of the first, and cast in their turn, and they who had taken the\nwater turned back and took their place behind the others, and many of the\nlight-armed came with them, and all the mass of them flowed forward\ntogether, looking as if it might never be broken.  But Otter would not\nabide the shock, since he had lost men and horses, and had no mind to be\ncaught in the sweep of their net; so he made the sign, and his Company\ndrew off to right and left, yet keeping within bowshot, so that the\nbowmen still loosed at the Romans.\n\nBut they for their part might not follow afoot men on untired horses, and\ntheir own horse was on the west side with the baggage, and had it been\nthere would have been but of little avail, as the Roman Captain knew.  So\nthey stood awhile making grim countenance, and then slowly drew back to\nthe ford under cover of their light-armed who shot at the Goths as they\nrode forward, but abode not their shock.\n\nBut Otter and his folk followed after the Romans again, and again did\nthem some hurt, and at last drew so nigh, that once more the Romans\nstormed forth, and once more smote a stroke in the air; nor even so would\nthe Markmen cease to meddle with them, though never would Otter suffer\nhis men to be mingled with them.  At the last the Romans, seeing that\nOtter would not walk into the open trap, and growing weary of this\nbickering, began to take the water little by little, while a strong\nCompany kept face to the Markmen; and now Otter saw that they would not\nbe hindered any longer, and he had lost many men, and even now feared\nlest he should be caught in the trap, and so lose all.  And on the other\nhand it was high noon by now, so that he had given respite to the stay-at-\nhomes of the Wolfings, so that they might get them into the wood.  So he\ndrew out of bowshot and bade his men breathe their horses and rest\nthemselves and eat something; and they did so gladly, since they saw that\nthey might not fall upon the Romans to live and die for it until Thiodolf\nwas come, or until they knew that he was not coming.  But the Romans\ncrossed the ford in good earnest and were soon all gathered together on\nthe western bank making them ready for the march to Wolfstead.  And it\nmust be told that the Roman Captain was the more deliberate about this\nbecause after the overthrow of his light-armed there the morning before,\nhe thought that the Roof was held by warriors of the kindreds, and not by\na few old men, and women, and lads.  Therefore he had no fear of their\nescaping him.  Moreover it was this imagination of his, to wit that a\nstrong band of warriors was holding Wolf-stead, that made him deem there\nwere no more worth thinking about of the warriors of the Mark save\nOtter's Company and the men in the Hall of the Wolfings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII--OTTER FALLS ON AGAINST HIS WILL\n\n\nIt was with the same imagination working in him belike that the Roman\nCaptain set none to guard the ford on the westward side of\nMirkwood-water.  The Romans tarried there but a little hour, and then\nwent their ways; but Otter sent a man on a swift horse to watch them, and\nwhen they were clean gone for half an hour, he bade his folk to horse,\nand they departed, all save a handful of the swains and elders, who were\nleft to tell the tidings to Thiodolf when he should come into Mid-mark.\n\nSo Otter and his folk crossed the ford, and drew up in good order on the\nwestward bank, and it was then somewhat more than three hours after noon.\nHe had been there but a little while before he noted a stir in the\nBearing meadow, and lo, it was the first of Thiodolf's folk, who had\ngotten out of the wood and had fallen in with the men whom he had left\nbehind.  And these first were the riders of the Bearings, and the\nWormings, (for they had out-gone the others who were afoot).  It may well\nbe thought how fearful was their anger when they set eyes on the\nsmouldering ashes of the dwellings; nor even when those folk of Otter had\ntold them all they had to tell could some of them refrain them from\nriding off to the burnt houses to seek for the bodies of their kindred.\nBut when they came there, and amidst the ashes could find no bones, their\nhearts were lightened, and yet so mad wroth they were, that some could\nscarce sit their horses, and great tears gushed from the eyes of some,\nand pattered down like hail-stones, so eager were they to see the blood\nof the Romans.  So they rode back to where they had left their folk\ntalking with them of Otter; and the Bearings were sitting grim upon their\nhorses and somewhat scowling on Otter's men.  Then the foremost of those\nwho had come back from the houses waved his hand toward the ford, but\ncould say nought for a while; but the captain and chief of the Bearings,\na grizzled man very big of body, whose name was Arinbiorn, spake to that\nman and said; \"What aileth thee Sweinbiorn the Black?  What hast thou\nseen?\"\n\nHe said:\n\n   \"Now red and grey is the pavement of the Bearings' house of old:\n   Red yet is the floor of the dais, but the hearth all grey and cold.\n   I knew not the house of my fathers; I could not call to mind\n   The fashion of the building of that Warder of the Wind.\n   O wide were grown the windows, and the roof exceeding high!\n   For nought there was to look on 'twixt the pavement and the sky.\n   But the tie-beam lay on the dais, and methought its staining fair;\n   For rings of smoothest charcoal were round it here and there,\n   And the red flame flickered o'er it, and never a staining wight\n   Hath red earth in his coffer so clear and glittering bright,\n   And still the little smoke-wreaths curled o'er it pale and blue.\n   Yea, fair is our hall's adorning for a feast that is strange and new.\"\n\nSaid Arinbiorn: \"What sawest thou therein, O Sweinbiorn, where sat thy\ngrandsire at the feast?  Where were the bones of thy mother lying?\"\n\nSaid Sweinbiorn:\n\n   \"We sought the feast-hall over, and nought we found therein\n   Of the bones of the ancient mothers, or the younglings of the kin.\n   The men are greedy, doubtless, to lose no whit of the prey,\n   And will try if the hoary elders may yet outlive the way\n   That leads to the southland cities, till at last they come to stand\n   With the younglings in the market to be sold in an alien land.\"\n\nArinbiorn's brow lightened somewhat; but ere he could speak again an\nancient thrall of the Galtings spake and said:\n\n\"True it is, O warriors of the Bearings, that we might not see any war-\nthralls being led away by the Romans when they came away from the burning\ndwellings; and we deem it certain that they crossed the water before the\ncoming of the Romans, and that they are now with the stay-at-homes of the\nWolfings in the wild-wood behind the Wolfing dwellings, for we hear tell\nthat the War-duke would not that the Hall-Sun should hold the Hall\nagainst the whole Roman host.\"\n\nThen Sweinbiorn tossed up his sword into the air and caught it by the\nhilts as it fell, and cried out: \"On, on to the meadow, where these\nthieves abide us!\"  Arinbiorn spake no word, but turned his horse and\nrode down to the ford, and all men followed him; and of the Bearings\nthere were an hundred warriors save one, and of the Wormings eighty and\nseven.\n\nSo rode they over the meadow and into the ford and over it, and Otter's\ncompany stood on the bank to meet them, and shouted to see them; but the\nothers made but little noise as they crossed the water.\n\nSo when they were on the western bank Arinbiorn came among them of Otter,\nand cried out: \"Where then is Otter, where is the War-duke, is he alive\nor dead?\"\n\nAnd the throng opened to him and Otter stood facing him; and Arinbiorn\nspake and said: \"Thou art alive and unhurt, War-duke, when many have been\nhurt and slain; and methinks thy company is little minished though the\nkindred of the Bearings lacketh a roof; and its elders and women and\nchildren are gone into captivity.  What is this?  Was it a light thing\nthat gangrel thieves should burn and waste in Mid-mark and depart unhurt,\nthat ye stand here with clean blades and cold bodies?\"\n\nSaid Otter: \"Thou grievest for the hurt of thine House, Arinbiorn; but\nthis at least is good, that though ye have lost the timber of your house\nye have not lost its flesh and blood; the shell is gone, but the kernel\nis saved: for thy folk are by this time in the wood with the Wolfing stay-\nat-homes, and among these are many who may fight on occasion, so they are\nsafe as for this time: the Romans may not come at them to hurt them.\"\n\nSaid Arinbiorn: \"Had ye time to learn all this, Otter, when ye fled so\nfast before the Romans, that the father tarried not for the son, nor the\nson for the father?\"\n\nHe spoke in a loud voice so that many heard him, and some deemed it evil;\nfor anger and dissension between friends seemed abroad; but some were so\neager for battle, that the word of Arinbiorn seemed good to them, and\nthey laughed for pride and anger.\n\nThen Otter answered meekly, for he was a wise man and a bold: \"We fled\nnot, Arinbiorn, but as the sword fleeth, when it springeth up from the\niron helm to fall on the woollen coat.  Are we not now of more avail to\nyou, O men of the Bearings, than our dead corpses would have been?\"\n\nArinbiorn answered not, but his face waxed red, as if he were struggling\nwith a weight hard to lift: then said Otter:\n\n\"But when will Thiodolf and the main battle be with us?\"\n\nArinbiorn answered calmly: \"Maybe in a little hour from now, or somewhat\nmore.\"\n\nSaid Otter: \"My rede is that we abide him here, and when we are all met\nand well ordered together, fall on the Romans at once: for then shall we\nbe more than they; whereas now we are far fewer, and moreover we shall\nhave to set on them in their ground of vantage.\"\n\nArinbiorn answered nothing; but an old man of the Bearings, one\nThorbiorn, came up and spake:\n\n\"Warriors, here are we talking and taking counsel, though this is no\nHallowed Thing to bid us what we shall do, and what we shall forbear; and\nto talk thus is less like warriors than old women wrangling over the why\nand wherefore of a broken crock.  Let the War-duke rule here, as is but\nmeet and right.  Yet if I might speak and not break the peace of the\nGoths, then would I say this, that it might be better for us to fall on\nthese Romans at once before they have cast up a dike about them, as Fox\ntelleth is their wont, and that even in an hour they may do much.\"\n\nAs he spake there was a murmur of assent about him, but Otter spake\nsharply, for he was grieved.\n\n\"Thorbiorn, thou art old, and shouldest not be void of prudence.  Now it\nhad been better for thee to have been in the wood to-day to order the\nwomen and the swains according to thine ancient wisdom than to egg on my\nyoung warriors to fare unwarily.  Here will I abide Thiodolf.\"\n\nThen Thorbiorn reddened and was wroth; but Arinbiorn spake:\n\n\"What is this to-do?  Let the War-duke rule as is but right: but I am now\nbecome a man of Thiodolf's company; and he bade me haste on before to\nhelp all I might.  Do thou as thou wilt, Otter: for Thiodolf shall be\nhere in an hour's space, and if much diking shall be done in an hour, yet\nlittle slaying, forsooth, shall be done, and that especially if the foe\nis all armed and slayeth women and children.  Yea if the Bearing women be\nall slain, yet shall not Tyr make us new ones out of the stones of the\nwaste to wed with the Galtings and the fish-eating Houses?--this is easy\nto be done forsooth.  Yea, easier than fighting the Romans and overcoming\nthem!\"\n\nAnd he was very wrath, and turned away; and again there was a murmur and\na hum about him.  But while these had been speaking aloud, Sweinbiorn had\nbeen talking softly to some of the younger men, and now he shook his\nnaked sword in the air and spake aloud and sang:\n\n   \"Ye tarry, Bears of Battle! ye linger, Sons of the Worm!\n   Ye crouch adown, O kindreds, from the gathering of the storm!\n   Ye say, it shall soon pass over and we shall fare afield\n   And reap the wheat with the war-sword and winnow in the shield.\n   But where shall be the corner wherein ye then shall abide,\n   And where shall be the woodland where the whelps of the bears shall\n   hide\n   When 'twixt the snowy mountains and the edges of the sea\n   These men have swept the wild-wood and the fields where men may be\n   Of every living sword-blade, and every quivering spear,\n   And in the southland cities the yoke of slaves ye bear?\n   Lo ye! whoever follows I fare to sow the seed\n   Of the days to be hereafter and the deed that comes of deed.\"\n\nTherewith he waved his sword over his head, and made as if he would spur\nonward.  But Arinbiorn thrust through the press and outwent him and cried\nout:\n\n\"None goeth before Arinbiorn the Old when the battle is pitched in the\nmeadows of the kindred.  Come, ye sons of the Bear, ye children of the\nWorm!  And come ye, whosoever hath a will to see stout men die!\"\n\nThen on he rode nor looked behind him, and the riders of the Bearings and\nthe Wormings drew themselves out of the throng, and followed him, and\nrode clattering over the meadow towards Wolfstead.  A few of the others\nrode with them, and yet but a few.  For they remembered the holy Folk-\nmote and the oath of the War-duke, and how they had chosen Otter to be\ntheir leader.  Howbeit, man looked askance at man, as if in shame to be\nleft behind.\n\nBut Otter bethought him in the flash of a moment, \"If these men ride\nalone, they shall die and do nothing; and if we ride with them it may be\nthat we shall overthrow the Romans, and if we be vanquished, it shall go\nhard but we shall slay many of them, so that it shall be the easier for\nThiodolf to deal with them.\"\n\nThen he spake hastily, and bade certain men abide at the ford for a\nguard; then he drew his sword and rode to the front of his folk, and\ncried out aloud to them:\n\n\"Now at last has come the time to die, and let them of the Markmen who\nlive hereafter lay us in howe.  Set on, Sons of Tyr, and give not your\nlives away, but let them be dearly earned of our foemen.\"\n\nThen all shouted loudly and gladly; nor were they otherwise than\nexceeding glad; for now had they forgotten all other joys of life save\nthe joy of fighting for the kindred and the days to be.\n\nSo Otter led them forth, and when he heard the whole company clattering\nand thundering on the earth behind him and felt their might enter into\nhim, his brow cleared, and the anxious lines in the face of the old man\nsmoothed themselves out, and as he rode along the soul so stirred within\nhim that he sang out aloud:\n\n   \"Time was when hot was the summer and I was young on the earth,\n   And I grudged me every moment that lacked its share of mirth.\n   I woke in the morn and was merry and all the world methought\n   For me and my heart's deliverance that hour was newly wrought.\n   I have passed through the halls of manhood, I have reached the doors\n   of eld,\n   And I have been glad and sorry, but ever have upheld\n   My heart against all trouble that none might call me sad,\n   But ne'er came such remembrance of how my heart was glad\n   In the afternoon of summer 'neath the still unwearied sun\n   Of the days when I was little and all deeds were hopes to be won,\n   As now at last it cometh when e'en in such-like tide,\n   For the freeing of my trouble o'er the fathers' field I ride.\"\n\nMany men perceived that he sang, and saw that he was merry, howbeit few\nheard his very words, and yet all were glad of him.\n\nFast they rode, being wishful to catch up with the Bearings and the\nWormings, and soon they came anigh them, and they, hearing the thunder of\nthe horse-hoofs, looked and saw that it was the company of Otter, and so\nslacked their speed till they were all joined together with joyous\nshouting and laughter.  So then they ordered the ranks anew and so set\nforward in great joy without haste or turmoil toward Wolfstead and the\nRomans.  For now the bitterness of their fury and the sourness of their\nabiding wrath were turned into the mere joy of battle; even as the clear\nred and sweet wine comes of the ugly ferment and rough trouble of the\nmust.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII--THIODOLF MEETETH THE ROMANS IN THE WOLFING MEADOW\n\n\nIt was scarce an hour after this that the footmen of Thiodolf came out of\nthe thicket road on to the meadow of the Bearings; there saw they men\ngathered on a rising ground, and they came up to them and saw how some of\nthem were looking with troubled faces towards the ford and what lay\nbeyond it, and some toward the wood and the coming of Thiodolf.  But\nthese were they whom Otter had bidden abide Thiodolf there, and he had\nsent two messengers to them for Thiodolf's behoof that he might have due\ntidings so soon as he came out of the thicket: the first told how Otter\nhad been compelled in a manner to fall on the Romans along with the\nriders of the Bearings and the Wormings, and the second who had but just\nthen come, told how the Markmen had been worsted by the Romans, and had\ngiven back from the Wolfing dwellings, and were making a stand against\nthe foemen in the meadow betwixt the ford and Wolfstead.\n\nNow when Thiodolf heard of these tidings he stayed not to ask long\nquestions, but led the whole host straightway down to the ford, lest the\nremnant of Otter's men should be driven down there, and the Romans should\nhold the western bank against him.\n\nAt the ford there was none to withstand them, nor indeed any man at all;\nfor the men whom Otter had set there, when they heard that the battle had\ngone against their kindred, had ridden their ways to join them.  So\nThiodolf crossed over the ford, he and his in good order all afoot, he\nlike to the others; but for him he was clad in the Dwarf-wrought Hauberk,\nbut was unhelmeted and bare no shield.  Throng-plough was naked in his\nhand as he came up all dripping on to the bank and stood in the meadow of\nthe Wolfings; his face was stern and set as he gazed straight onward to\nthe place of the fray, but he did not look as joyous as his wont was in\ngoing down to the battle.\n\nNow they had gone but a short way from the ford before the noise of the\nfight and the blowing of horns came down the wind to them, but it was a\nlittle way further before they saw the fray with their eyes; because the\nground fell away from the river somewhat at first, and then rose and fell\nagain before it went up in one slope toward the Wolfing dwellings.\n\nBut when they were come to the top of the next swelling of the ground,\nthey beheld from thence what they had to deal with; for there round about\na ground of vantage was the field black with the Roman host, and in the\nmidst of it was a tangle of struggling men and tossing spears, and\nglittering swords.\n\nSo when they beheld the battle of their kindred they gave a great shout\nand hastened onward the faster; and they were ordered into the\nwedge-array and Thiodolf led them, as meet it was.  And now even as they\nwho were on the outward edge of the array and could see what was toward\nwere looking on the battle with eager eyes, there came an answering shout\ndown the wind, which they knew for the voice of the Goths amid the\nfoemen, and then they saw how the ring of the Romans shook and parted,\nand their array fell back, and lo the company of the Markmen standing\nstoutly together, though sorely minished; and sure it was that they had\nnot fled or been scattered, but were ready to fall one over another in\none band, for there were no men straggling towards the ford, though many\nmasterless horses ran here and there about the meadow.  Now, therefore,\nnone doubted but that they would deliver their friends from the Romans,\nand overthrow the foemen.\n\nBut now befel a wonder, a strange thing to tell of.  The Romans soon\nperceived what was adoing, whereupon the half of them turned about to\nface the new comers, while the other half still withstood the company of\nOtter: the wedge-array of Thiodolf drew nearer and nearer till it was\nhard on the place where it should spread itself out to storm down on the\nfoe, and the Goths beset by the Romans made them ready to fall on from\ntheir side.  There was Thiodolf leading his host, and all men looking for\nthe token and sign to fall on; but even as he lifted up Throng-plough to\ngive that sign, a cloud came over his eyes and he saw nought of all that\nwas before him, and he staggered back as one who hath gotten a deadly\nstroke, and so fell swooning to the earth, though none had smitten him.\nThen stayed was the wedge-array even at the very point of onset, and the\nhearts of the Goths sank, for they deemed that their leader was slain,\nand those who were nearest to him raised him up and bore him hastily\naback out of the battle; and the Romans also had beheld him fall, and\nthey also deemed him dead or sore hurt, and shouted for joy and loitered\nnot, but stormed forth on the wedge-array like valiant men; for it must\nbe told that they, who erst out-numbered the company of Otter, were now\nmuch out-numbered, but they deemed it might well be that they could\ndismay the Goths since they had been stayed by the fall of their leader;\nand Otter's company were wearied with sore fighting against a great host.\nNevertheless these last, who had not seen the fall of Thiodolf (for the\nRomans were thick between him and them) fell on with such exceeding fury\nthat they drove the Romans who faced them back on those who had set on\nthe wedge-array, which also stood fast undismayed; for he who stood next\nto Thiodolf, a man big of body, and stout of heart, hight Thorolf, hove\nup a great axe and cried out aloud:\n\n\"Here is the next man to Thiodolf! here is one who will not fall till\nsome one thrusts him over, here is Thorolf of the Wolfings!  Stand fast\nand shield you, and smite, though Thiodolf be gone untimely to the Gods!\"\n\nSo none gave back a foot, and fierce was the fight about the wedge-array;\nand the men of Otter--but there was no Otter there, and many another man\nwas gone, and Arinbiorn the Old led them--these stormed on so fiercely\nthat they cleft their way through all and joined themselves to their\nkindred, and the battle was renewed in the Wolfing meadow.  But the\nRomans had this gain, that Thiodolf's men had let go their occasion for\nfalling on the Romans with their line spread out so that every man might\nuse his weapons; yet were the Goths strong both in valiancy and in\nnumbers, nor might the Romans break into their array, and as aforesaid\nthe Romans were the fewer, for it was less than half of their host that\nhad pursued the Goths when they had been thrust back from their fierce\nonset: nor did more than the half seem needed, so many of them had fallen\nalong with Otter the War-duke and Sweinbiorn of the Bearings, that they\nseemed to the Romans but a feeble band easy to overcome.\n\nSo fought they in the Wolfing meadow in the fifth hour after high-noon,\nand neither yielded to the other: but while these things were a-doing,\nmen laid Thiodolf adown aloof from the battle under a doddered oak half a\nfurlong from where the fight was a-doing, round whose bole clung flocks\nof wool from the sheep that drew around it in the hot summer-tide and\nrubbed themselves against it, and the ground was trodden bare of grass\nround the bole, and close to the trunk was worn into a kind of trench.\nThere then they laid Thiodolf, and they wondered that no blood came from\nhim, and that there was no sign of a shot-weapon in his body.\n\nBut as for him, when he fell, all memory of the battle and what had gone\nbefore it faded from his mind, and he passed into sweet and pleasant\ndreams wherein he was a lad again in the days before he had fought with\nthe three Hun-Kings in the hazelled field.  And in these dreams he was\ndoing after the manner of young lads, sporting in the meadows, backing\nunbroken colts, swimming in the river, going a-hunting with the elder\ncarles.  And especially he deemed that he was in the company of one old\nman who had taught him both wood-craft and the handling of weapons: and\nfair at first was his dream of his doings with this man; he was with him\nin the forge smithying a sword-blade, and hammering into its steel the\nthin golden wires; and fishing with an angle along with him by the eddies\nof Mirkwood-water; and sitting with him in an ingle of the Hall, the old\nman telling a tale of an ancient warrior of the Wolfings hight Thiodolf\nalso: then suddenly and without going there, they were in a little\nclearing of the woods resting after hunting, a roe-deer with an arrow in\nher lying at their feet, and the old man was talking, and telling\nThiodolf in what wise it was best to go about to get the wind of a hart;\nbut all the while there was going on the thunder of a great gale of wind\nthrough the woodland boughs, even as the drone of a bag-pipe cleaves to\nthe tune.  Presently Thiodolf arose and would go about his hunting again,\nand stooped to take up his spear, and even therewith the old man's speech\nstayed, and Thiodolf looked up, and lo, his face was white like stone,\nand he touched him, and he was hard as flint, and like the image of an\nancient god as to his face and hands, though the wind stirred his hair\nand his raiment, as they did before.  Therewith a great pang smote\nThiodolf in his dream, and he felt as if he also were stiffening into\nstone, and he strove and struggled, and lo, the wild-wood was gone, and a\nwhite light empty of all vision was before him, and as he moved his head\nthis became the Wolfing meadow, as he had known it so long, and thereat a\nsoft pleasure and joy took hold of him, till again he looked, and saw\nthere no longer the kine and sheep, and the herd-women tending them, but\nthe rush and turmoil of that fierce battle, the confused thundering noise\nof which was going up to the heavens; for indeed he was now fully awake\nagain.\n\nSo he stood up and looked about; and around him was a ring of the\nsorrowful faces of the warriors, who had deemed that he was hurt deadly,\nthough no hurt could they find upon him.  But the Dwarf-wrought Hauberk\nlay upon the ground beside him; for they had taken it off him to look for\nhis hurts.\n\nSo he looked into their faces and said: \"What aileth you, ye men?  I am\nalive and unhurt; what hath betided?\"\n\nAnd one said: \"Art thou verily alive, or a man come back from the dead?\nWe saw thee fall as thou wentest leading us against the foe as if thou\nhadst been smitten by a thunder-bolt, and we deemed thee dead or\ngrievously hurt.  Now the carles are fighting stoutly, and all is well\nsince thou livest yet.\"\n\nSo he said: \"Give me the point and edges that I know, that I may smite\nmyself therewith and not the foemen; for I have feared and blenched from\nthe battle.\"\n\nSaid an old warrior: \"If that be so, Thiodolf, wilt thou blench twice?  Is\nnot once enough?  Now let us go back to the hard handplay, and if thou\nwilt, smite thyself after the battle, when we have once more had a man's\nhelp of thee.\"\n\nTherewith he held out Throng-plough to him by the point, and Thiodolf\ntook hold of the hilts and handled it and said: \"Let us hasten, while the\nGods will have it so, and while they are still suffering me to strike a\nstroke for the kindred.\"\n\nAnd therewith he brandished Throng-plough, and went forth toward the\nbattle, and the heart grew hot within him, and the joy of waking life\ncame back to him, the joy which but erewhile he had given to a mere\ndream.\n\nBut the old man who had rebuked him stooped down and lifted the Hauberk\nfrom the ground, and cried out after him, \"O Thiodolf, and wilt thou go\nnaked into so strong a fight? and thou with this so goodly\nsword-rampart?\"\n\nThiodolf stayed a moment, and even therewith they looked, and lo! the\nRomans giving back before the Goths and the Goths following up the chase,\nbut slowly and steadily.  Then Thiodolf heeded nothing save the battle,\nbut ran forward hastily, and those warriors followed him, the old man\nlast of all holding the Hauberk in his hand, and muttering:\n\n   \"So fares hot blood to the glooming and the world beneath the grass;\n   And the fruit of the Wolfings' orchard in a flash from the world must\n   pass.\n   Men say that the tree shall blossom in the garden of the folk,\n   And the new twig thrust him forward from the place where the old one\n   broke,\n   And all be well as aforetime: but old and old I grow,\n   And I doubt me if such another the folk to come shall know.\"\n\nAnd he still hurried forward as fast as his old body might go, so that he\nmight wrap the safeguard of the Hauberk round Thiodolf's body.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV--THE GOTHS ARE OVERTHROWN BY THE ROMANS\n\n\nNow rose up a mighty shout when Thiodolf came back to the battle of the\nkindreds, for many thought he had been slain; and they gathered round\nabout him, and cried out to him joyously out of their hearts of\ngood-fellowship, and the old man who had rebuked Thiodolf, and who was\nJorund of the Wolfings, came up to him and reached out to him the\nHauberk, and he did it on scarce heeding; for all his heart and soul was\nturned toward the battle of the Romans and what they were a-doing; and he\nsaw that they were falling back in good order, as men out-numbered, but\nundismayed.  So he gathered all his men together and ordered them afresh;\nfor they were somewhat disarrayed with the fray and the chase: and now he\nno longer ordered them in the wedge array, but in a line here three deep,\nhere five deep, or more, for the foes were hard at hand, and outnumbered,\nand so far overcome, that he and all men deemed it a little matter to\ngive these their last overthrow, and then onward to Wolf-stead to storm\non what was left there and purge the house of the foemen.  Howbeit\nThiodolf bethought him that succour might come to the Romans from their\nmain-battle, as they needed not many men there, since there was nought to\nfear behind them: but the thought was dim within him, for once more since\nhe had gotten the Hauberk on him the earth was wavering and dream-like:\nhe looked about him, and nowise was he as in past days of battle when he\nsaw nought but the foe before him, and hoped for nothing save the\nvictory.  But now indeed the Wood-Sun seemed to him to be beside him, and\nnot against his will, as one besetting and hindering him, but as though\nhis own longing had drawn her thither and would not let her depart; and\nwhiles it seemed to him that her beauty was clearer to be seen than the\nbodies of the warriors round about him.  For the rest he seemed to be in\na dream indeed, and, as men do in dreams, to be for ever striving to be\ndoing something of more moment than anything which he did, but which he\nmust ever leave undone.  And as the dream gathered and thickened about\nhim the foe before him changed to his eyes, and seemed no longer the\nstern brown-skinned smooth-faced men under their crested iron helms with\ntheir iron-covered shields before them, but rather, big-headed men, small\nof stature, long-bearded, swart, crooked of body, exceeding foul of\naspect.  And he looked on and did nothing for a while, and his head\nwhirled as though he had been grievously smitten.\n\nThus tarried the kindreds awhile, and they were bewildered and their\nhearts fell because Thiodolf did not fly on the foemen like a falcon on\nthe quarry, as his wont was.  But as for the Romans, they had now stayed,\nand were facing their foes again, and that on a vantage-ground, since the\nfield sloped up toward the Wolfing dwelling; and they gathered heart when\nthey saw that the Goths tarried and forbore them.  But the sun was\nsinking, and the evening was hard at hand.\n\nSo at last Thiodolf led forward with Throng-plough held aloft in his\nright hand; but his left hand he held out by his side, as though he were\nleading someone along.  And as he went, he muttered: \"When will these\naccursed sons of the nether earth leave the way clear to us, that we may\nbe alone and take pleasure each in each amidst of the flowers and the\nsun?\"\n\nNow as the two hosts drew near to one another, again came the sound of\ntrumpets afar off, and men knew that this would be succour coming to the\nRomans from their main-battle, and the Romans thereon shouted for joy,\nand the host of the kindreds might no longer forbear, but rushed on\nfiercely against them; and for Thiodolf it was now come to this, that so\nentangled was he in his dream that he rather went with his men than led\nthem.  Yet had he Throng-plough in his right hand, and he muttered in his\nbeard as he went, \"Smite before! smite behind! and smite on the right\nhand! but never on the left!\"\n\nThus then they met, and as before, neither might the Goths sweep the\nRomans away, nor the Romans break the Goths into flight; yet were many of\nthe kindred anxious and troubled, since they knew that aid was coming to\nthe Romans, and they heard the trumpets sounding nearer and more joyous;\nand at last, as the men of the kindreds were growing a-wearied with\nfighting, they heard those horns as it were in their very ears, and the\nthunder of the tramp of footmen, and they knew that a fresh host of men\nwas upon them; then those they had been fighting with opened before them,\nfalling aside to the right and the left, and the fresh men passing\nbetween them, fell on the Goths like the waters of a river when a sluice-\ngate is opened.  They came on in very good order, never breaking their\nranks, but swift withal, smiting and pushing before them, and so brake\nthrough the array of the Goth-folk, and drave them this way and that way\ndown the slopes.\n\nYet still fought the warriors of the kindred most valiantly, making stand\nand facing the foe again and again in knots of a score or two score, or\nmaybe ten score; and though many a man was slain, yet scarce any one\nbefore he had slain or hurt a Roman; and some there were, and they the\noldest, who fought as if they and the few about them were all the host\nthat was left to the folk, and heeded not that others were driven back,\nor that the Romans gathered about them, cutting them off from all succour\nand aid, but went on smiting till they were felled with many strokes.\n\nHowbeit the array of the Goths was broken and many were slain, and\nperforce they must give back, and it seemed as if they would be driven\ninto the river and all be lost.\n\nBut for Thiodolf, this befell him: that at first, when those fresh men\nfell on, he seemed, as it were, to wake unto himself again, and he cried\naloud the cry of the Wolf, and thrust into the thickest of the fray, and\nslew many and was hurt of none, and for a moment of time there was an\nempty space round about him, such fear he cast even into the valiant\nhearts of the foemen.  But those who had time to see him as they stood by\nhim noted that he was as pale as a dead man, and his eyes set and\nstaring; and so of a sudden, while he stood thus threatening the ring of\ndoubtful foemen, the weakness took him again, Throng-plough tumbled from\nhis hand, and he fell to earth as one dead.\n\nThen of those who saw him some deemed that he had been striving against\nsome secret hurt till he could do no more; and some that there was a\ncurse abroad that had fallen upon him and upon all the kindreds of the\nMark; some thought him dead and some swooning.  But, dead or alive, the\nwarriors would not leave their War-duke among the foemen, so they lifted\nhim, and gathered about him a goodly band that held its own against all\ncomers, and fought through the turmoil stoutly and steadily; and others\ngathered to them, till they began to be something like a host again, and\nthe Romans might not break them into knots of desperate men any more.\n\nThus they fought their way, Arinbiorn of the Bearings leading them now,\nwith a mind to make a stand for life or death on some vantage-ground; and\nso, often turning upon the Romans, they came in array ever growing more\nsolid to the rising ground looking one way over the ford and the other to\nthe slopes where the battle had just been.  There they faced the foe as\nmen who may be slain, but will be driven no further; and what bowmen they\nhad got spread out from their flanks and shot on the Romans, who had with\nthem no light-armed, or slingers or bowmen, for they had left them at\nWolf-stead.  So the Romans stood a while, and gave breathing-space to the\nMarkmen, which indeed was the saving of them: for if they had fallen on\nhotly and held to it steadily, it is like that they would have passed\nover all the bodies of the Markmen: for these had lost their leader,\neither slain, as some thought, or, as others thought, banned from\nleadership by the Gods; and their host was heavy-hearted; and though it\nis like that they would have stood there till each had fallen over other,\nyet was their hope grown dim, and the whole folk brought to a perilous\nand fearful pass, for if these were slain or scattered there were no more\nbut they, and nought between fire and the sword and the people of the\nMark.\n\nBut once again the faint-heart folly of the Roman Captain saved his foes:\nfor whereas he once thought that the whole power of the Markmen lay in\nOtter and his company, and deemed them too little to meddle with, so now\nhe ran his head into the other hedge, and deemed that Thiodolf's company\nwas but a part of the succour that was at hand for the Goths, and that\nthey were over-big for him to meddle with.\n\nTrue it is also that now dark night was coming on, and the land was\nunknown to the Romans, who moreover trusted not wholly to the dastards of\nthe Goths who were their guides and scouts: furthermore the wood was at\nhand, and they knew not what it held; and with all this and above it all,\nit is to be said that over them also had fallen a dread of some doom\nanear; for those habitations amidst of the wild-woods were terrible to\nthem as they were dear to the Goths; and the Gods of their foemen seemed\nto be lying in wait to fall upon them, even if they should slay every man\nof the kindreds.\n\nSo now having driven back the Goths to that height over the ford, which\nindeed was no stronghold, no mountain, scarce a hill even, nought but a\ngentle swelling of the earth, they forebore them; and raising up the\nwhoop of victory drew slowly aback, picking up their own dead and\nwounded, and slaying the wounded Markmen.  They had with them also some\nfew captives, but not many; for the fighting had been to the death\nbetween man and man on the Wolfing Meadow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV--THE HOST OF THE MARKMEN COMETH INTO THE WILD-WOOD\n\n\nYet though the Romans were gone, the Goth-folk were very hard bested.\nThey had been overthrown, not sorely maybe if they had been in an alien\nland, and free to come and go as they would; yet sorely as things were,\nbecause the foeman was sitting in their own House, and they must needs\ndrag him out of it or perish: and to many the days seemed evil, and the\nGods fighting against them, and both the Wolfings and the other kindreds\nbethought them of the Hall-Sun and her wisdom and longed to hear of\ntidings concerning her.\n\nBut now the word ran through the host that Thiodolf was certainly not\nslain.  Slowly he had come to himself, and yet was not himself, for he\nsat among his men gloomy and silent, clean contrary to his wont; for\nhitherto he had been a merry man, and a joyous fellow.\n\nAmidst of the ridge whereon the Markmen now abode, there was a ring made\nof the chief warriors and captains and wise men who had not been slain or\ngrievously hurt in the fray, and amidst them all sat Thiodolf on the\nground, his chin sunken on his breast, looking more like a captive than\nthe leader of a host amidst of his men; and that the more as his scabbard\nwas empty; for when Throng-plough had fallen from his hand, it had been\ntrodden under foot, and lost in the turmoil.  There he sat, and the\nothers in that ring of men looked sadly upon him; such as Arinbiorn of\nthe Bearings, and Wolfkettle and Thorolf of his own House, and Hiarandi\nof the Elkings, and Geirbald the Shielding, the messenger of the woods,\nand Fox who had seen the Roman Garth, and many others.  It was night now,\nand men had lighted fires about the host, for they said that the Romans\nknew where to find them if they listed to seek; and about those fires\nwere men eating and drinking what they might come at, but amidmost of\nthat ring was the biggest fire, and men turned them towards it for\ncounsel and help, for elsewhere none said, \"What do we?\" for they were\nheavy-hearted and redeless, since the Gods had taken the victory out of\ntheir hands just when they seemed at point to win it.\n\nBut amidst all this there was a little stir outside that biggest ring,\nand men parted, and through them came a swain amongst the chiefs, and\nsaid, \"Who will lead me to the War-duke?\"\n\nThiodolf, who was close beside the lad, answered never a word; but\nArinbiorn said; \"This man here sitting is the War-duke: speak to him, for\nhe may hearken to thee: but first who art thou?\"\n\nSaid the lad; \"My name is Ali the son of Grey, and I come with a message\nfrom the Hall-Sun and the stay-at-homes who are in the Woodland.\"\n\nNow when he named the Hall-Sun Thiodolf started and looked up, and\nturning to his left-hand said, \"And what sayeth thy daughter?\"\n\nMen did not heed that he said _thy_ daughter, but deemed that he said\n_my_ daughter, since he was wont as her would-be foster-father to call\nher so.  But Ali spake:\n\n\"War-duke and ye chieftains, thus saith the Hall-Sun: 'I know that by\nthis time Otter hath been slain and many another, and ye have been\noverthrown and chased by the Romans, and that now there is little counsel\nin you except to abide the foe where ye are and there to die valiantly.\nBut now do my bidding and as I am bidden, and then whosoever dieth or\nliveth, the kindreds shall vanquish that they may live and grow greater.\nDo ye thus: the Romans think no otherwise but to find you here to-morrow\nor else departed across the water as broken men, and they will fall upon\nyou with their whole host, and then make a war-garth after their manner\nat Wolf-stead and carry fire and the sword and the chains of thralldom\ninto every House of the Mark.  Now therefore fetch a compass and come\ninto the wood on the north-west of the houses and make your way to the\nThing-stead of the Mid-mark.  For who knoweth but that to-morrow we may\nfall upon these thieves again?  Of this shall ye hear more when we may\nspeak together and take counsel face to face; for we stay-at-homes know\nsomewhat closely of the ways of these Romans.  Haste then! let not the\ngrass grow over your feet!\n\n\"'But to thee, Thiodolf, have I a word to say when we meet; for I wot\nthat as now thou canst not hearken to my word.'  Thus saith the\nHall-Sun.\"\n\n\"Wilt thou speak, War-duke?\" said Arinbiorn.  But Thiodolf shook his\nhead.  Then said Arinbiorn; \"Shall I speak for thee?\" and Thiodolf nodded\nyea.  Then said Arinbiorn: \"Ali son of Grey, art thou going back to her\nthat sent thee?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the lad, \"but in your company, for ye will be coming\nstraightway and I know all the ways closely; and there is need for a\nguide through the dark night as ye will see presently.\"\n\nThen stood up Arinbiorn and said: \"Chiefs and captains, go ye speedily\nand array your men for departure: bid them leave all the fires burning\nand come their ways as silently as maybe; for now will we wend this same\nhour before moonrise into the Wild-wood and the Thing-stead of Mid-mark;\nthus saith the War-duke.\"\n\nBut when they were gone, and Arinbiorn and Thiodolf were left alone,\nThiodolf lifted up his head and spake slowly and painfully:\n\n\"Arinbiorn, I thank thee: and thou dost well to lead this folk: since as\nfor me that is somewhat that weighs me down, and I know not whether it be\nlife or death; therefore I may no longer be your captain, for twice now\nhave I blenched from the battle.  Yet command me, and I will obey, set a\nsword in my hand and I will smite, till the God snatches it out of my\nhand, as he did Throng-plough to-day.\"\n\n\"And that is well,\" said Arinbiorn, \"it may be that ye shall meet that\nGod to-morrow, and heave up sword against him, and either overcome him or\ngo to thy fathers a proud and valiant man.\"\n\nSo they spake, and Thiodolf stood up and seemed of better cheer.  But\npresently the whole host was afoot, and they went their ways warily with\nlittle noise, and wound little by little about the Wolfing meadow and\nabout the acres towards the wood at the back of the Houses; and they met\nnothing by the way except an out-guard of the Romans, whom they slew\nthere nigh silently, and bore away their bodies, twelve in number, lest\nthe Romans when they sent to change the guard, should find the slain and\nhave an inkling of the way the Goths were gone; but now they deemed that\nthe Romans might think their guard fled, or perchance that they had been\ncarried away by the Gods of the woodland folk.\n\nSo came they into the wood, and Arinbiorn and the chiefs were for\nstriking the All-men's road to the Thing-stead and so coming thither; but\nthe lad Ali when he heard it laughed and said:\n\n\"If ye would sleep to-night ye shall wend another way.  For the Hall-Sun\nhath had us at work cumbering it against the foe with great trees felled\nwith limbs, branches, and all.  And indeed ye shall find the Thing-stead\nfenced like a castle, and the in-gate hard to find; yet will I bring you\nthither.\"\n\nSo did he without delay, and presently they came anigh the Thing-stead;\nand the place was fenced cunningly, so that if men would enter they must\ngo by a narrow way that had a fence of tree-trunks on each side wending\ninward like the maze in a pleasance.  Thereby now wended the host all\nafoot, since it was a holy place and no beast must set foot therein, so\nthat the horses were left without it: so slowly and right quietly once\nmore they came into the garth of the Thing-stead; and lo, a many folk\nthere, of the Wolfings and the Bearings and other kindreds, who had\ngathered thereto; and albeit these were not warriors in their prime, yet\nwere there none save the young children and the weaker of the women but\nhad weapons of some kind; and they were well ordered, standing or sitting\nin ranks like folk awaiting battle.  There were booths of boughs and\nrushes set up for shelter of the feebler women and the old men and\nchildren along the edges of the fence, for the Hall-Sun had bidden them\nkeep the space clear round about the Doom-ring and the Hill-of-Speech as\nif for a mighty folk-mote, so that the warriors might have room to muster\nthere and order their array.  There were some cooking-fires lighted about\nthe aforesaid booths, but neither many nor great, and they were screened\nwith wattle from the side that lay toward the Romans; for the Hall-Sun\nwould not that they should hold up lanterns for their foemen to find them\nby.  Little noise there was in that stronghold, moreover, for the hearts\nof all who knew their right hands from their left were set on battle and\nthe destruction of the foe that would destroy the kindreds.\n\nAnigh the Speech-Hill, on its eastern side, had the bole of a slender\nbeech tree been set up, and at the top of it a cross-beam was nailed on,\nand therefrom hung the wondrous lamp, the Hall-Sun, glimmering from on\nhigh, and though its light was but a glimmer amongst the mighty wood, yet\nwas it also screened on three sides from the sight of the chance wanderer\nby wings of thin plank.  But beneath her namesake as beforetime in the\nHall sat the Hall-Sun, the maiden, on a heap of faggots, and she was\nwrapped in a dark blue cloak from under which gleamed the folds of the\nfair golden-broidered gown she was wont to wear at folk-motes, and her\nright hand rested on a naked sword that lay across her knees: beside her\nsat the old man Sorli, the Wise in War, and about her were slim lads and\nsturdy maidens and old carles of the thralls or freedmen ready to bear\nthe commands that came from her mouth; for she and Sorli were the\ncaptains of the stay-at-homes.\n\nNow came Thiodolf and Arinbiorn and other leaders into the ring of men\nbefore her, and she greeted them kindly and said:\n\n\"Hail, Sons of Tyr! now that I behold you again it seemeth to me as if\nall were already won: the time of waiting hath been weary, and we have\nborne the burden of fear every day from morn till even, and in the waking\nhour we presently remembered it.  But now ye are come, even if this Thing-\nstead were lighted by the flames of the Wolfing Roof instead of by these\nmoonbeams; even if we had to begin again and seek new dwellings, and\nanother water and other meadows, yet great should grow the kindreds of\nthe Men who have dwelt in the Mark, and nought should overshadow them:\nand though the beasts and the Romans were dwelling in their old places,\nyet should these kindreds make new clearings in the Wild-wood; and they\nwith their deeds should cause other waters to be famous, that as yet have\nknown no deeds of man; and they should compel the Earth to bear increase\nround about their dwelling-places for the welfare of the kindreds.  O\nSons of Tyr, friendly are your faces, and undismayed, and the Terror of\nthe Nations has not made you afraid any more than would the onrush of the\nbisons that feed adown the grass hills.  Happy is the eve, O children of\nthe Goths, yet shall to-morrow morn be happier.\"\n\nMany heard what she spake, and a murmur of joy ran through the ranks of\nmen: for they deemed her words to forecast victory.\n\nAnd now amidst her speaking, the moon, which had arisen on Mid-mark, when\nthe host first entered into the wood, had overtopped the tall trees that\nstood like a green wall round about the Thing-stead, and shone down on\nthat assembly, and flashed coldly back from the arms of the warriors.  And\nthe Hall-Sun cast off her dark blue cloak and stood up in her\ngolden-broidered raiment, which flashed back the grey light like as it\nhad been an icicle hanging from the roof of some hall in the midnight of\nYule, when the feast is high within, and without the world is silent with\nthe night of the ten-weeks' frost.\n\nThen she spake again: \"O War-duke, thy mouth is silent; speak to this\nwarrior of the Bearings that he bid the host what to do; for wise are ye\nboth, and dear are the minutes of this night and should not be wasted;\nsince they bring about the salvation of the Wolfings, and the vengeance\nof the Bearings, and the hope renewed of all the kindreds.\"\n\nThen Thiodolf abode a while with his head down cast; his bosom heaved,\nand he set his left hand to his swordless scabbard, and his right to his\nthroat, as though he were sore troubled with something he might not tell\nof: but at last he lifted up his head and spoke to Arinbiorn, but slowly\nand painfully, as he had spoken before:\n\n\"Chief of the Bearings, go up on to the Hill of Speech, and speak to the\nfolk out of thy wisdom, and let them know that to-morrow early before the\nsun-rising those that may, and are not bound by the Gods against it,\nshall do deeds according to their might, and win rest for themselves, and\nnew days of deeds for the kindreds.\"\n\nTherewith he ceased, and let his head fall again, and the Hall-Sun looked\nat him askance.  But Arinbiorn clomb the Speech-Hill and said:\n\n\"Men of the kindreds, it is now a few days since we first met the Romans\nand fought with them; and whiles we have had the better, and whiles the\nworse in our dealings, as oft in war befalleth: for they are men, and we\nno less than men.  But now look to it what ye will do; for we may no\nlonger endure these outlanders in our houses, and we must either die or\nget our own again: and that is not merely a few wares stored up for use,\nnor a few head of neat, nor certain timbers piled up into a dwelling, but\nthe life we have made in the land we have made.  I show you no choice,\nfor no choice there is.  Here are we bare of everything in the wild-wood:\nfor the most part our children are crying for us at home, our wives are\nlonging for us in our houses, and if we come not to them in kindness, the\nRomans shall come to them in grimness.  Down yonder in the plain,\nmoreover, is our wain-burg slowly drawing near to us, and with it is much\nlivelihood of ours, which is a little thing, for we may get more; but\nalso there are our banners of battle and the tokens of the kindred, which\nis a great thing.  And between all this and us there lieth but little;\nnought but a band of valiant men, and a few swords and spears, and a few\nwounds, and the hope of death amidst the praise of the people; and this\nye have to set out to wend across within two or three hours.  I will not\nask if ye will do so, for I wot that even so ye will; therefore when I\nhave done, shout not, nor clash sword on shield, for we are no great way\noff that house of ours wherein dwells the foe that would destroy us.  Let\neach man rest as he may, and sleep if he may with his war-gear on him and\nhis weapons by his side, and when he is next awakened by the captains and\nthe leaders of hundreds and scores, let him not think that it is night,\nbut let him betake himself to his place among his kindred and be ready to\ngo through the wood with as little noise as may be.  Now all is said that\nthe War-duke would have me say, and to-morrow shall those see him who are\nforemost in falling upon the foemen, for he longeth sorely for his seat\non the days of the Wolfing Hall.\"\n\nSo he spake, and even as he bade them, they made no sound save a joyous\nmurmur; and straightway the more part of them betook themselves to sleep\nas men who must busy themselves about a weighty matter; for they were\nwise in the ways of war.  So sank all the host to the ground save those\nwho were appointed as watchers of the night, and Arinbiorn and Thiodolf\nand the Hall-Sun; they three yet stood together; and Arinbiorn said:\n\n\"Now it seems to me not so much as if we had vanquished the foe and were\nsafe and at rest, but rather as if we had no foemen and never have had.\nDeep peace is on me, though hitherto I have been deemed a wrathful man,\nand it is to me as if the kindreds that I love had filled the whole\nearth, and left no room for foemen: even so it may really be one day.  To-\nnight it is well, yet to-morrow it shall be better.  What thine errand\nmay be, Thiodolf, I scarce know; for something hath changed in thee, and\nthou art become strange to us.  But as for mine errand, I will tell it\nthee; it is that I am seeking Otter of the Laxings, my friend and fellow,\nwhose wisdom my foolishness drave under the point and edge of the Romans,\nso that he is no longer here; I am seeking him, and to-morrow I think I\nshall find him, for he hath not had time to travel far, and we shall be\nblithe and merry together.  And now will I sleep; for I have bidden the\nwatchers awaken me if any need be.  Sleep thou also, Thiodolf! and wake\nup thine old self when the moon is low.\"  Therewith he laid himself down\nunder the lee of the pile of faggots, and was presently asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI--THIODOLF TALKETH WITH THE WOOD-SUN\n\n\nNow were Thiodolf and the Hall-Sun left alone together standing by the\nSpeech-Hill; and the moon was risen high in the heavens above the tree-\ntops of the wild-wood.  Thiodolf scarce stirred, and he still held his\nhead bent down as one lost in thought.\n\nThen said the Hall-Sun, speaking softly amidst the hush of the camp:\n\n\"I have said that the minutes of this night are dear, and they are\npassing swiftly; and it may be that thou wilt have much to say and to do\nbefore the host is astir with the dawning.  So come thou with me a little\nway, that thou mayst hear of new tidings, and think what were best to do\namidst them.\"\n\nAnd without more ado she took him by the hand and led him forth, and he\nwent as he was led, not saying a word.  They passed out of the camp into\nthe wood, none hindering, and went a long way where under the\nbeech-leaves there was but a glimmer of the moonlight, and presently\nThiodolf's feet went as it were of themselves; for they had hit a path\nthat he knew well and over-well.\n\nSo came they to that little wood-lawn where first in this tale Thiodolf\nmet the Wood-Sun; and the stone seat there was not empty now any more\nthan it was then; for thereon sat the Wood-Sun, clad once more in her\nglittering raiment.  Her head was sunken down, her face hidden by her\nhands; neither did she look up when she heard their feet on the grass,\nfor she knew who they were.\n\nThiodolf lingered not; for a moment it was to him as if all that past\ntime had never been, and its battles and hurry and hopes and fears but\nmere shows, and the unspoken words of a dream.  He went straight up to\nher and sat down by her side and put his arm about her shoulders, and\nstrove to take her hand to caress it; but she moved but little, and it\nwas as if she heeded him not.  And the Hall-Sun stood before them and\nlooked at them for a little while; and then she fell to speech; but at\nthe first sound of her voice, it seemed that the Wood-Sun trembled, but\nstill she hid her face.  Said the Hall-Sun:\n\n   \"Two griefs I see before me in mighty hearts grown great;\n   And to change both these into gladness out-goes the power of fate.\n   Yet I, a lonely maiden, have might to vanquish one\n   Till it melt as the mist of the morning before the summer sun.\n   O Wood-Sun, thou hast borne me, and I were fain indeed\n   To give thee back thy gladness; but thou com'st of the Godhead's seed,\n   And herein my might avails not; because I can but show\n   Unto these wedded sorrows the truth that the heart should know\n   Ere the will hath wielded the hand; and for thee, I can tell thee\n   nought\n   That thou hast not known this long while; thy will and thine hand have\n   wrought,\n   And the man that thou lovest shall live in despite of Gods and of men,\n   If yet thy will endureth.  But what shall it profit thee then\n   That after the fashion of Godhead thou hast gotten thee a thrall\n   To be thine and never another's, whatso in the world may befall?\n   Lo! yesterday this was a man, and to-morrow it might have been\n   The very joy of the people, though never again it were seen;\n   Yet a part of all they hoped for through all the lapse of years,\n   To make their laughter happy and dull the sting of tears;\n   To quicken all remembrance of deeds that never die,\n   And death that maketh eager to live as the days go by.\n   Yea, many a deed had he done as he lay in the dark of the mound;\n   As the seed-wheat plotteth of spring, laid under the face of the\n   ground\n   That the foot of the husbandman treadeth, that the wind of the winter\n   wears,\n   That the turbid cold flood hideth from the constant hope of the years.\n   This man that should leave in his death his life unto many an one\n   Wilt thou make him a God of the fearful who live lone under the sun?\n   And then shalt thou have what thou wouldedst when amidst of the\n   hazelled field\n   Thou kissed'st the mouth of the helper, and the hand of the people's\n   shield,\n   Shalt thou have the thing that thou wouldedst when thou broughtest me\n   to birth,\n   And I, the soul of the Wolfings, began to look on earth?\n   Wilt thou play the God, O mother, and make a man anew,\n   A joyless thing and a fearful?  Then I betwixt you two,\n   'Twixt your longing and your sorrow will cast the sundering word,\n   And tell out all the story of that rampart of the sword!\n   I shall bid my mighty father make choice of death in life,\n   Or life in death victorious and the crowned end of strife.\"\n\nEre she had ended, the Wood-Sun let her hands fall down, and showed her\nface, which for all its unpaled beauty looked wearied and anxious; and\nshe took Thiodolf's hand in hers, while she looked with eyes of love upon\nthe Hall-Sun, and Thiodolf laid his cheek to her cheek, and though he\nsmiled not, yet he seemed as one who is happy.  At last the Wood-Sun\nspoke and said:\n\n   \"Thou sayest sooth, O daughter: I am no God of might,\n   Yet I am of their race, and I think with their thoughts and see with\n   their sight,\n   And the threat of the doom did I know of, and yet spared not to lie:\n   For I thought that the fate foreboded might touch and pass us by,\n   As the sword that heweth the war-helm and cleaveth a cantle away,\n   And the cunning smith shall mend it and it goeth again to the fray;\n   If my hand might have held for a moment, yea, even against his will,\n   The life of my beloved!  But Weird is the master still:\n   And this man's love of my body and his love of the ancient kin\n   Were matters o'er mighty to deal with and the game withal to win.\n   Woe's me for the waning of all things, and my hope that needs must\n   fade\n   As the fruitless sun of summer on the waste where nought is made!\n   And now farewell, O daughter, thou mayst not see the kiss\n   Of the hapless and the death-doomed when I have told of this;\n   Yet once again shalt thou see him, though I no more again,\n   Fair with the joy that hopeth and dieth not in vain.\"\n\nThen came the Hall-Sun close to her, and knelt down by her, and laid her\nhead upon her knees and wept for love of her mother, who kissed her oft\nand caressed her; and Thiodolf's hand strayed, as it were, on to his\ndaughter's head, and he looked kindly on her, though scarce now as if he\nknew her.  Then she arose when she had kissed her mother once more, and\nwent her ways from that wood-lawn into the woods again, and so to the\nFolk-mote of her people.\n\nBut when those twain were all alone again, the Wood-Sun spoke: \"O\nThiodolf canst thou hear me and understand?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he said, \"when thou speakest of certain matters, as of our love\ntogether, and of our daughter that came of our love.\"\n\n\"Thiodolf,\" she said, \"How long shall our love last?\"\n\n\"As long as our life,\" he said.\n\n\"And if thou diest to-day, where then shall our love be?\" said the Wood-\nSun.\n\nHe said, \"I must now say, I wot not; though time was I had said, It shall\nabide with the soul of the Wolfing Kindred.\"\n\nShe said: \"And when that soul dieth, and the kindred is no more?\"\n\n\"Time agone,\" quoth he, \"I had said, it shall abide with the Kindreds of\nthe Earth; but now again I say, I wot not.\"\n\n\"Will the Earth hide it,\" said she, \"when thou diest and art borne to\nmound?\"\n\n\"Even so didst thou say when we spake together that other night,\" said\nhe; \"and now I may say nought against thy word.\"\n\n\"Art thou happy, O Folk-Wolf?\" she said.\n\n\"Why dost thou ask me?\" said he; \"I know not; we were sundered and I\nlonged for thee; thou art here; it is enough.\"\n\n\"And the people of thy Kindred?\" she said, \"dost thou not long for them?\"\n\nHe said; \"Didst thou not say that I was not of them?  Yet were they my\nfriends, and needed me, and I loved them: but by this evening they will\nneed me no more, or but little; for they will be victorious over their\nfoes: so hath the Hall-Sun foretold.  What then! shall I take all from\nthee to give little to them?\"\n\n\"Thou art wise,\" she said; \"Wilt thou go to battle to-day?\"\n\n\"So it seemeth,\" said he.\n\nShe said: \"And wilt thou bear the Dwarf-wrought Hauberk? for if thou\ndost, thou wilt live, and if thou dost not, thou wilt die.\"\n\n\"I will bear it,\" said he, \"that I may live to love thee.\"\n\n\"Thinkest thou that any evil goes with it?\" said she.\n\nThere came into his face a flash of his ancient boldness as he answered:\n\"So it seemed to me yesterday, when I fought clad in it the first time;\nand I fell unsmitten on the meadow, and was shamed, and would have slain\nmyself but for thee.  And yet it is not so that any evil goes with it;\nfor thou thyself didst say that past night that there was no evil weird\nin it.\"\n\nShe said: \"How then if I lied that night?\"\n\nSaid he; \"It is the wont of the Gods to lie, and be unashamed, and men-\nfolk must bear with it.\"\n\n\"Ah! how wise thou art!\" she said; and was silent for a while, and drew\naway from him a little, and clasped her hands together and wrung them for\ngrief and anger.  Then she grew calm again, and said:\n\n\"Wouldest thou die at my bidding?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"not because thou art of the Gods, but because thou hast\nbecome a woman to me, and I love thee.\"\n\nThen was she silent some while, and at last she said, \"Thiodolf, wilt\nthou do off the Hauberk if I bid thee?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" said he, \"and let us depart from the Wolfings, and their\nstrife, for they need us not.\"\n\nShe was silent once more for a longer while still, and at last she said\nin a cold voice; \"Thiodolf, I bid thee arise, and put off the Hauberk\nfrom thee.\"\n\nHe looked at her wondering, not at her words, but at the voice wherewith\nshe spake them; but he arose from the stone nevertheless, and stood stark\nin the moonlight; he set his hand to the collar of the war-coat, and\nundid its clasps, which were of gold and blue stones, and presently he\ndid the coat from off him and let it slide to the ground where it lay in\na little grey heap that looked but a handful.  Then he sat down on the\nstone again, and took her hand and kissed her and caressed her fondly,\nand she him again, and they spake no word for a while: but at the last he\nspake in measure and rhyme in a low voice, but so sweet and clear that it\nmight have been heard far in the hush of the last hour of the night:\n\n   \"Dear now are this dawn-dusk's moments as is the last of the light\n   When the foemen's ranks are wavering, and the victory feareth night;\n   And of all the time I have loved thee of these am I most fain,\n   When I know not what shall betide me, nor what shall be my gain.\n   But dear as they are, they are waning, and at last the time is come\n   When no more shall I behold thee till I wend to Odin's Home.\n   Now is the time so little that once hath been so long\n   That I fain would ask thee pardon wherein I have done thee wrong,\n   That thy longing might be softer, and thy love more sweet to have.\n   But in nothing have I wronged thee, there is nought that I may crave.\n   Strange too! as the minutes fail me, so do my speech-words fail,\n   Yet strong is the joy within me for this hour that crowns the tale.\"\n\nTherewith he clipped her and caressed her, and she spake nothing for a\nwhile; and he said; \"Thy face is fair and bright; art thou not joyous of\nthese minutes?\"\n\nShe said: \"Thy words are sweet; but they pierce my heart like a sharp\nknife; for they tell me of thy death and the ending of our love.\"\n\nSaid he; \"I tell thee nothing, beloved, that thou hast not known: is it\nnot for this that we have met here once more?\"\n\nShe answered after a while; \"Yea, yea; yet mightest thou have lived.\"\n\nHe laughed, but not scornfully or bitterly and said:\n\n\"So thought I in time past: but hearken, beloved; If I fall to-day, shall\nthere not yet be a minute after the stroke hath fallen on me, wherein I\nshall know that the day is won and see the foemen fleeing, and wherein I\nshall once again deem I shall never die, whatever may betide afterwards,\nand though the sword lieth deep in my breast?  And shall I not see then\nand know that our love hath no end?\"\n\nBitter grief was in her face as she heard him.  But she spake and said:\n\"Lo here the Hauberk which thou hast done off thee, that thy breast might\nbe the nearer to mine!  Wilt thou not wear it in the fight for my sake?\"\n\nHe knit his brows somewhat, and said:\n\n\"Nay, it may not be: true it is that thou saidest that no evil weird went\nwith it, but hearken!  Yesterday I bore it in the fight, and ere I\nmingled with the foe, before I might give the token of onset, a cloud\ncame before my eyes and thick darkness wrapped me around, and I fell to\nthe earth unsmitten; and so was I borne out of the fight, and evil dreams\nbeset me of evil things, and the dwarfs that hate mankind.  Then I came\nto myself, and the Hauberk was off me, and I rose up and beheld the\nbattle, that the kindreds were pressing on the foe, and I thought not\nthen of any past time, but of the minutes that were passing; and I ran\ninto the fight straightway: but one followed me with that Hauberk, and I\ndid it on, thinking of nought but the battle.  Fierce then was the fray,\nyet I faltered in it; till the fresh men of the Romans came in upon us\nand broke up our array.  Then my heart almost broke within me, and I\nfaltered no more, but rushed on as of old, and smote great strokes all\nround about: no hurt I got, but once more came that ugly mist over my\neyes, and again I fell unsmitten, and they bore me out of battle: then\nthe men of our folk gave back and were overcome; and when I awoke from my\nevil dreams, we had gotten away from the fight and the Wolfing dwellings,\nand were on the mounds above the ford cowering down like beaten men.\nThere then I sat shamed among the men who had chosen me for their best\nman at the Holy Thing, and lo I was their worst!  Then befell that which\nnever till then had befallen me, that life seemed empty and worthless and\nI longed to die and be done with it, and but for the thought of thy love\nI had slain myself then and there.\n\n\"Thereafter I went with the host to the assembly of the stay-at-homes and\nfleers, and sat before the Hall-Sun our daughter, and said the words\nwhich were put into my mouth.  But now must I tell thee a hard and evil\nthing; that I loved them not, and was not of them, and outside myself\nthere was nothing: within me was the world and nought without me.  Nay,\nas for thee, I was not sundered from thee, but thou wert a part of me;\nwhereas for the others, yea, even for our daughter, thine and mine, they\nwere but images and shows of men, and I longed to depart from them, and\nto see thy body and to feel thine heart beating.  And by then so evil was\nI grown that my very shame had fallen from me, and my will to die: nay, I\nlonged to live, thou and I, and death seemed hateful to me, and the deeds\nbefore death vain and foolish.\n\n\"Where then was my glory and my happy life, and the hope of the days\nfresh born every day, though never dying?  Where then was life, and\nThiodolf that once had lived?\n\n\"But now all is changed once more; I loved thee never so well as now, and\ngreat is my grief that we must sunder, and the pain of farewell wrings my\nheart.  Yet since I am once more Thiodolf the Mighty, in my heart there\nis room for joy also.  Look at me, O Wood-Sun, look at me, O beloved!\ntell me, am I not fair with the fairness of the warrior and the helper of\nthe folk?  Is not my voice kind, do not my lips smile, and mine eyes\nshine?  See how steady is mine hand, the friend of the folk!  For mine\neyes are cleared again, and I can see the kindreds as they are, and their\ndesire of life and scorn of death, and this is what they have made me\nmyself.  Now therefore shall they and I together earn the merry days to\ncome, the winter hunting and the spring sowing, the summer haysel, the\ningathering of harvest, the happy rest of midwinter, and Yuletide with\nthe memory of the Fathers, wedded to the hope of the days to be.  Well\nmay they bid me help them who have holpen me!  Well may they bid me die\nwho have made me live!\n\n\"For whereas thou sayest that I am not of their blood, nor of their\nadoption, once more I heed it not.  For I have lived with them, and eaten\nand drunken with them, and toiled with them, and led them in battle and\nthe place of wounds and slaughter; they are mine and I am theirs; and\nthrough them am I of the whole earth, and all the kindreds of it; yea,\neven of the foemen, whom this day the edges in mine hand shall smite.\n\n\"Therefore I will bear the Hauberk no more in battle; and belike my body\nbut once more: so shall I have lived and death shall not have undone me.\n\n\"Lo thou, is not this the Thiodolf whom thou hast loved? no changeling of\nthe Gods, but the man in whom men have trusted, the friend of Earth, the\ngiver of life, the vanquisher of death?\"\n\nAnd he cast himself upon her, and strained her to his bosom and kissed\nher, and caressed her, and awoke the bitter-sweet joy within her, as he\ncried out:\n\n\"O remember this, and this, when at last I am gone from thee!\"\n\nBut when they sundered her face was bright, but the tears were on it, and\nshe said: \"O Thiodolf, thou wert fain hadst thou done a wrong to me so\nthat I might forgive thee; now wilt thou forgive me the wrong I have done\nthee?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he said, \"Even so would I do, were we both to live, and how much\nmore if this be the dawn of our sundering day!  What hast thou done?\"\n\nShe said: \"I lied to thee concerning the Hauberk when I said that no evil\nweird went with it: and this I did for the saving of thy life.\"\n\nHe laid his hand fondly on her head, and spake smiling: \"Such is the wont\nof the God-kin, because they know not the hearts of men.  Tell me all the\ntruth of it now at last.\"\n\nShe said:\n\n   \"Hear then the tale of the Hauberk and the truth there is to tell:\n   There was a maid of the God-kin, and she loved a man right well,\n   Who unto the battle was wending; and she of her wisdom knew\n   That thence to the folk-hall threshold should come back but a very\n   few;\n   And she feared for her love, for she doubted that of these he should\n   not be;\n   So she wended the wilds lamenting, as I have lamented for thee;\n   And many wise she pondered, how to bring her will to pass\n   (E'en as I for thee have pondered), as her feet led over the grass,\n   Till she lifted her eyes in the wild-wood, and lo! she stood before\n   The Hall of the Hollow-places; and the Dwarf-lord stood in the door\n   And held in his hand the Hauberk, whereon the hammer's blow\n   The last of all had been smitten, and the sword should be hammer now.\n   Then the Dwarf beheld her fairness, and the wild-wood many-leaved\n   Before his eyes was reeling at the hope his heart conceived;\n   So sorely he longed for her body; and he laughed before her and cried,\n   'O Lady of the Disir, thou farest wandering wide\n   Lamenting thy beloved and the folk-mote of the spear,\n   But if amidst of the battle this child of the hammer he bear\n   He shall laugh at the foemen's edges and come back to thy lily breast\n   And of all the days of his life-time shall his coming years be best.'\n   Then she bowed adown her godhead and sore for the Hauberk she prayed;\n   But his greedy eyes devoured her as he stood in the door and said;\n   'Come lie in mine arms!  Come hither, and we twain the night to wake!\n   And then as a gift of the morning the Hauberk shall ye take.'\n   So she humbled herself before him, and entered into the cave,\n   The dusky, the deep-gleaming, the gem-strewn golden grave.\n   But he saw not her girdle loosened, or her bosom gleam on his love,\n   For she set the sleep-thorn in him, that he saw, but might not move,\n   Though the bitter salt tears burned him for the anguish of his greed;\n   And she took the hammer's offspring, her unearned morning meed,\n   And went her ways from the rock-hall and was glad for her warrior's\n   sake.\n   But behind her dull speech followed, and the voice of the hollow\n   spake:\n   'Thou hast left me bound in anguish, and hast gained thine heart's\n   desire;\n   Now I would that the dewy night-grass might be to thy feet as the\n   fire,\n   And shrivel thy raiment about thee, and leave thee bare to the flame,\n   And no way but a fiery furnace for the road whereby ye came!\n   But since the folk of God-home we may not slay nor smite,\n   And that fool of the folk that thou lovest, thou hast saved in my\n   despite,\n   Take with thee, thief of God-home, this other word I say:\n   Since the safeguard wrought in the ring-mail I may not do away\n   I lay this curse upon it, that whoso weareth the same,\n   Shall save his life in the battle, and have the battle's shame;\n   He shall live through wrack and ruin, and ever have the worse,\n   And drag adown his kindred, and bear the people's curse.'\n\n   \"Lo, this the tale of the Hauberk, and I knew it for the truth:\n   And little I thought of the kindreds; of their day I had no ruth;\n   For I said, They are doomed to departure; in a little while must they\n   wane,\n   And nought it helpeth or hindreth if I hold my hand or refrain.\n   Yea, thou wert become the kindred, both thine and mine; and thy birth\n   To me was the roofing of heaven, and the building up of earth.\n   I have loved, and I must sorrow; thou hast lived, and thou must die;\n   Ah, wherefore were there others in the world than thou and I?\"\n\nHe turned round to her and clasped her strongly in his arms again, and\nkissed her many times and said:\n\n   \"Lo, here art thou forgiven; and here I say farewell!\n   Here the token of my wonder which my words may never tell;\n   The wonder past all thinking, that my love and thine should blend;\n   That thus our lives should mingle, and sunder in the end!\n   Lo, this, for the last remembrance of the mighty man I was,\n   Of thy love and thy forbearing, and all that came to pass!\n   Night wanes, and heaven dights her for the kiss of sun and earth;\n   Look up, look last upon me on this morn of the kindreds' mirth!\"\n\nTherewith he arose and lingered no minute longer, but departed, going as\nstraight towards the Thing-stead and the Folk-mote of his kindred as the\nswallow goes to her nest in the hall-porch.  He looked not once behind\nhim, though a bitter wailing rang through the woods and filled his heart\nwith the bitterness of her woe and the anguish of the hour of sundering.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII--THEY WEND TO THE MORNING BATTLE\n\n\nNow when Thiodolf came back to the camp the signs of dawn were plain in\nthe sky, the moon was low and sinking behind the trees, and he saw at\nonce that the men were stirring and getting ready for departure.  He\nlooked gladly and blithely at the men he fell in with, and they at him,\nand scarce could they refrain a shout when they beheld his face and the\nbrightness of it.  He went straight up to where the Hall-Sun was yet\nsitting under her namesake, with Arinbiorn standing before her amidst of\na ring of leaders of hundreds and scores: but old Sorli sat by her side\nclad in all his war-gear.\n\nWhen Thiodolf first came into that ring of men they looked doubtfully at\nhim, as if they dreaded somewhat, but when they had well beheld him their\nfaces cleared, and they became joyous.\n\nHe went straight up to Arinbiorn and kissed the old warrior, and said to\nhim, \"I give thee good morrow, O leader of the Bearings!  Here now is\ncome the War-duke! and meseems that we should get to work as speedily as\nmay be, for lo the dawning!\"\n\n\"Hail to thine hand, War-duke!\" said Arinbiorn joyously; \"there is no\nmore to do but to take thy word concerning the order wherein we shall\nwend; for all men are armed and ready.\"\n\nSaid Thiodolf; \"Lo ye, I lack war-gear and weapons!  Is there a good\nsword hereby, a helm, a byrny and a shield?  For hard will be the battle,\nand we must fence ourselves all we may.\"\n\n\"Hard by,\" said Arinbiorn, \"is the war-gear of Ivar of our House, who is\ndead in the night of his hurts gotten in yesterday's battle: thou and he\nare alike in stature, and with a good will doth he give them to thee, and\nthey are goodly things, for he comes of smithying blood.  Yet is it a\npity of Throng-plough that he lieth on the field of the slain.\"\n\nBut Thiodolf smiled and said: \"Nay, Ivar's blade shall serve my turn to-\nday; and thereafter shall it be seen to, for then will be time for many\nthings.\"\n\nSo they went to fetch him the weapons; but he said to Arinbiorn, \"Hast\nthou numbered the host?  What are the gleanings of the Roman sword?\"\n\nSaid Arinbiorn: \"Here have we more than three thousand three hundred\nwarriors of the host fit for battle: and besides this here are gathered\neighteen hundred of the Wolfings and the Bearings, and of the other\nHouses, mostly from over the water, and of these nigh upon seven hundred\nmay bear sword or shoot shaft; neither shall ye hinder them from so doing\nif the battle be joined.\"\n\nThen said Thiodolf: \"We shall order us into three battles; the Wolfings\nand the Bearings to lead the first, for this is our business; but others\nof the smaller Houses this side the water to be with us; and the Elkings\nand Galtings and the other Houses of the Mid-mark on the further side of\nthe water to be in the second, and with them the more part of the Nether-\nmark; but the men of Up-mark to be in the third, and the stay-at-homes to\nfollow on with them: and this third battle to let the wood cover them\ntill they be needed, which may not be till the day of fight draws to an\nend, when all shall be needed: for no Roman man must be left alive or\nuntaken by this even, or else must we all go to the Gods together.\nHearken, Arinbiorn.  I am not called fore-sighted, and yet meseems I see\nsomewhat how this day shall go; and it is not to be hidden that I shall\nnot see another battle until the last of all battles is at hand.  But be\nof good cheer, for I shall not die till the end of the fight, and once\nmore I shall be a man's help unto you.  Now the first of the Romans we\nmeet shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall be unready, and\nwhen their men are gotten ready and are fighting with us grimly, ye of\nthe second battle shall hear the war-token, and shall fall on, and they\nshall be dismayed when they see so many fresh men come into the fight;\nyet shall they stand stoutly; for they are valiant men, and shall not all\nbe taken unawares.  Then, if they withstand us long enough, shall the\nthird battle come forth from the wood, and fall on either flank of them,\nand the day shall be won.  But I think not that they shall withstand us\nso long, but that the men of Up-mark and the stay-at-homes shall have the\nchasing of them.  Now get me my war-gear, and let the first battle get\nthem to the outgate of the garth.\"\n\nSo they brought him his arms; and meanwhile the Hall-Sun spake to one of\nthe Captains, and he turned and went away a little space, and then came\nback, having with him three strong warriors of the Wolfings, and he\nbrought them before the Hall-Sun, who said to them:\n\n\"Ye three, Steinulf, Athalulf, and Grani the Grey, I have sent for you\nbecause ye are men both mighty in battle and deft wood-wrights and house-\nsmiths; ye shall follow Thiodolf closely, when he winneth into the Roman\ngarth, yet shall ye fight wisely, so that ye be not slain, or at least\nnot all; ye shall enter the Hall with Thiodolf, and when ye are therein,\nif need be, ye shall run down the Hall at your swiftest, and mount up\ninto the loft betwixt the Middle-hearth and the Women's-Chamber, and\nthere shall ye find good store of water in vats and tubs, and this ye\nshall use for quenching the fire of the Hall if the foemen fire it, as is\nnot unlike to be.\"\n\nThen Grani spoke for the others and said he would pay all heed to her\nwords, and they departed to join their company.\n\nNow was Thiodolf armed; and Arinbiorn, turning about before he went to\nhis place, beheld him and knit his brow, and said: \"What is this,\nThiodolf?  Didst thou not swear to the Gods not to bear helm or shield in\nthe battles of this strife? yet hast thou Ivar's helm on thine head and\nhis shield ready beside thee: wilt thou forswear thyself? so doing shalt\nthou bring woe upon the House.\"\n\n\"Arinbiorn,\" said Thiodolf, \"where didst thou hear tell of me that I had\nmade myself the thrall of the Gods?  The oath that I sware was sworn when\nmine heart was not whole towards our people; and now will I break it that\nI may keep what of good intent there was in it, and cast away the rest.\nLong is the story; but if we journey together to-night I will tell it\nthee.  Likewise I will tell it to the Gods if they look sourly upon me\nwhen I see them, and all shall be well.\"\n\nHe smiled as he spoke, and Arinbiorn smiled on him in turn and went his\nways to array the host.  But when he was gone Thiodolf was alone in that\nplace with the Hall-Sun, and he turned to her, and kissed her, and\ncaressed her fondly, and spake and said:\n\n   \"So fare we, O my daughter, to the sundering of the ways;\n   Short is my journey henceforth to the door that ends my days,\n   And long the road that lieth as yet before thy feet.\n   How fain were I that thy journey from day to day were sweet\n   With peace to thee and pleasure; that a noble warrior's hand\n   In its early days might lead thee adown the flowery land,\n   And thy children in its noon-tide cling round about thy gown,\n   And the wise that thy womb has carried when the sun is going down,\n   Be thy happy fellow-farers to tell the tale of Earth,\n   But I wot that for no such sweetness did we bring thee unto birth,\n   But to be the soul of the Wolfings till the other days should come,\n   And the fruit of the kindreds' harvest with thee is garnered home.\n   Yet if for no blithe faring thy life-day is ordained,\n   Yet peace that long endureth maybe thy soul hath gained;\n   And thy sorrow of this even thy latest grief shall be,\n   The grief wherewith thou singest the death-song over me.\"\n\nShe looked up at him and smiled, though the tears were on her face; then\nshe said:\n\n   \"Though to-day the grief beginneth yet the bitterness is done.\n   Though my body wendeth barren 'neath the beams of the quickening sun,\n   Yet remembrance still abideth, and long after the days of my life\n   Shall I live in the tale of the morning, when they tell of the ending\n   of strife;\n   And the deeds of this little hand, and the thought conceived in my\n   heart,\n   And never again henceforward from the folk shall I fare apart.\n   And if of the Earth, my father, thou hast tidings in thy place\n   Thou shalt hear how they call me the Ransom and the Mother of happy\n   days.\"\n\nThen she wept outright for a brief space, and thereafter she said:\n\n   \"Keep this in thine heart, O father, that I shall remember all\n   Since thou liftedst the she-wolf's nursling in the oak-tree's leafy\n   hall.\n   Yea, every time I remember when hand in hand we went\n   Amidst the shafts of the beech-trees, and down to the youngling bent\n   The Folk-wolf in his glory when the eve of fight drew nigh;\n   And every time I remember when we wandered joyfully\n   Adown the sunny meadow and lived a while of life\n   'Midst the herbs and the beasts and the waters so free from fear and\n   strife,\n   That thy years and thy might and thy wisdom, I had no part therein;\n   But thou wert as the twin-born brother of the maiden slim and thin,\n   The maiden shy in the feast-hall and blithe in wood and field.\n   Thus have we fared, my father; and e'en now when thou bearest shield,\n   On the last of thy days of mid-earth, twixt us 'tis even so\n   That the heart of my like-aged brother is the heart of thee that I\n   know.\"\n\nThen the bitterness of tears stayed her speech, and he spake no word\nmore, but took her in his arms a while and soothed her and fondled her,\nand then they parted, and he went with great strides towards the outgoing\nof the Thing-stead.\n\nThere he found the warriors of his House and of the Bearings and the\nlesser Houses of Mid-mark, all duly ordered for wending through the wood.\nThe dawn was coming on apace, but the wood was yet dark.  But whereas the\nWolfings led, and each man of them knew the wood like his own hand, there\nwas no straying or disarray, and in less than a half-hour's space\nThiodolf and the first battle were come to the wood behind the\nhazel-trees at the back of the hall, and before them was the dawning\nround about the Roof of the Kindred; the eastern heavens were\nbrightening, and they could see all things clear without the wood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII--OF THE STORM OF DAWNING\n\n\nThen Thiodolf bade Fox and two others steal forward, and see what of\nfoemen was before them; so they fell to creeping on towards the open: but\nscarcely had they started, before all men could hear the tramp of men\ndrawing nigh; then Thiodolf himself took with him a score of his House\nand went quietly toward the wood-edge till they were barely within the\nshadow of the beech-wood; and he looked forth and saw men coming straight\ntowards their lurking-place.  And those he saw were a good many, and they\nwere mostly of the dastards of the Goths; but with them was a Captain of\nan Hundred of the Romans, and some others of his kindred; and Thiodolf\ndeemed that the Goths had been bidden to gather up some of the\nnight-watchers and enter the wood and fall on the stay-at-homes.  So he\nbade his men get them aback, and he himself abode still at the very\nwood's edge listening intently with his sword bare in his hand.  And he\nnoted that those men of the foe stayed in the daylight outside the wood,\nbut a few yards from it, and, by command as it seemed, fell silent and\nspake no word; and the morn was very still, and when the sound of their\ntramp over the grass had ceased, Thiodolf could hear the tramp of more\nmen behind them.  And then he had another thought, to wit that the Romans\nhad sent scouts to see if the Goths yet abided on the vantage-ground by\nthe ford, and that when they had found them gone, they were minded to\nfall on them unawares in the refuge of the Thing-stead and were about to\ndo so by the counsel and leading of the dastard Goths; and that this was\none body of the host led by those dastards, who knew somewhat of the\nwoods.  So he drew aback speedily, and catching hold of Fox by the\nshoulder (for he had taken him alone with him) he bade him creep along\nthrough the wood toward the Thing-stead, and bring back speedy word\nwhether there were any more foemen near the wood thereaway; and he\nhimself came to his men, and ordered them for onset, drawing them up in a\nshallow half moon, with the bowmen at the horns thereof, with the word to\nloose at the Romans as soon as they heard the war-horn blow: and all this\nwas done speedily and with little noise, for they were well nigh so\narrayed already.\n\nThus then they waited, and there was more than a glimmer of light even\nunder the beechen leaves, and the eastern sky was yellowing to sunrise.\nThe other warriors were like hounds in the leash eager to be slipped; but\nThiodolf stood calm and high-hearted turning over the memory of past\ndays, and the time he thought of seemed long to him, but happy.\n\nScarce had a score of minutes passed, and the Romans before them, who\nwere now gathered thick behind those dastards of the Goths, had not\nmoved, when back comes Fox and tells how he has come upon a great company\nof the Romans led by their thralls of the Goths who were just entering\nthe wood, away there towards the Thing-stead.\n\n\"But, War-duke,\" says he, \"I came also across our own folk of the second\nbattle duly ordered in the wood ready to meet them; and they shall be\nwell dealt with, and the sun shall rise for us and not for them.\"\n\nThen turns Thiodolf round to those nighest to him and says, but still\nsoftly:\n\n   \"Hear ye a word, O people, of the wisdom of the foe!\n   Before us thick they gather, and unto the death they go.\n   They fare as lads with their cur-dogs who have stopped a fox's earth,\n   And standing round the spinny, now chuckle in their mirth,\n   Till one puts by the leafage and trembling stands astare\n   At the sight of the Wood wolf's father arising in his lair--\n   They have come for our wives and our children, and our sword-edge\n   shall they meet;\n   And which of them is happy save he of the swiftest feet?\"\n\nSpeedily then went that word along the ranks of the Kindred, and men were\nmerry with the restless joy of battle: but scarce had two minutes passed\nere suddenly the stillness of the dawn was broken by clamour and uproar;\nby shouts and shrieks, and the clashing of weapons from the wood on their\nleft hand; and over all arose the roar of the Markmen's horn, for the\nbattle was joined with the second company of the Kindreds.  But a rumour\nand murmur went from the foemen before Thiodolf's men; and then sprang\nforth the loud sharp word of the captains commanding and rebuking, as if\nthe men were doubtful which way they should take.\n\nAmidst all which Thiodolf brandished his sword, and cried out in a great\nvoice:\n\n   \"Now, now, ye War-sons!\n   Now the Wolf waketh!\n   Lo how the Wood-beast\n   Wendeth in onset.\n   E'en as his feet fare\n   Fall on and follow!\"\n\nAnd he led forth joyously, and terrible rang the long refrained gathered\nshout of his battle as his folk rushed on together devouring the little\nspace between their ambush and the hazel-beset greensward.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye the half-moon had lapped around the\nRoman-Goths and those that were with them; and the dastards made no stand\nbut turned about at once, crying out that the Gods of the Kindreds were\ncome to aid and none could withstand them.  But these fleers thrust\nagainst the band of Romans who were next to them, and bore them aback,\nand great was the turmoil; and when Thiodolf's storm fell full upon them,\nas it failed not to do, so close were they driven together that scarce\ncould any man raise his hand for a stroke.  For behind them stood a great\ncompany of those valiant spearmen of the Romans, who would not give way\nif anywise they might hold it out: and their ranks were closely serried,\nshield nigh touching shield, and their faces turned toward the foe; and\nso arrayed, though they might die, they scarce knew how to flee.  As they\nmight these thrust and hewed at the fleers, and gave fierce words but few\nto the Roman-Goths, driving them back against their foemen: but the\nfleers had lost the cunning of their right hands, and they had cast away\ntheir shields and could not defend their very bodies against the wrath of\nthe kindreds; and when they strove to flee to the right hand or to the\nleft, they were met by the horns of the half-moon, and the arrows began\nto rain in upon them, and from so close were they shot at that no shaft\nfailed to smite home.\n\nThere then were the dastards slain; and their bodies served for a rampart\nagainst the onrush of the Markmen to those Romans who had stood fast.  To\nthem were gathering more and more every minute, and they faced the Goths\nsteadily with their hard brown visages and gleaming eyes above their iron-\nplated shields; not casting their spears, but standing closely together,\nsilent, but fierce.  The light was spread now over all the earth; the\neastern heavens were grown golden-red, flecked here and there with little\ncrimson clouds: this battle was fallen near silent, but to the North was\ngreat uproar of shouts and cries, and the roaring of the war-horns, and\nthe shrill blasts of the brazen trumpets.\n\nNow Thiodolf, as his wont was when he saw that all was going well, had\nrefrained himself of hand-strokes, but was here and there and everywhere\ngiving heart to his folk, and keeping them in due order, and close array,\nlest the Romans should yet come among them.  But he watched the ranks of\nthe foe, and saw how presently they began to spread out beyond his, and\nmight, if it were not looked to, take them in flank; and he was about to\norder his men anew to meet them, when he looked on his left hand and saw\nhow Roman men were pouring thick from the wood out of all array, followed\nby a close throng of the kindreds: for on this side the Romans were\noutnumbered and had stumbled unawares into the ambush of the Markmen, who\nhad fallen on them straightway and disarrayed them from the first.  This\nflight of their folk the Romans saw also, and held their men together,\nrefraining from the onset, as men who deem that they will have enough to\ndo to stand fast.\n\nBut the second battle of the Markmen, (who were of the Nether-mark,\nmingled with the Mid-mark) fought wisely, for they swept those fleers\nfrom before them, slaying many and driving the rest scattering, yet held\nthe chase for no long way, but wheeling about came sidelong on toward the\nbattle of the Romans and Thiodolf.  And when Thiodolf saw that, he set up\nthe whoop of victory, he and his, and fell fiercely on the Romans,\ncasting everything that would fly, as they rushed on to the handplay; so\nthat there was many a Roman slain with the Roman spears that those who\nhad fallen had left among their foemen.\n\nNow the Roman captains perceived that it availed not to tarry till the\nmen of the Mid and Nether-marks fell upon their flank; so they gave\ncommand, and their ranks gave back little by little, facing their foes,\nand striving to draw themselves within the dike and garth, which, after\ntheir custom, they had already cast up about the Wolfing Roof, their\nstronghold.\n\nNow as fierce as was the onset of the Markmen, the main body of the\nRomans could not be hindered from doing this much before the men of the\nsecond battle were upon them; but Thiodolf and Arinbiorn with some of the\nmightiest brake their array in two places and entered in amongst them.\nAnd wrath so seized upon the soul of Arinbiorn for the slaying of Otter,\nand his own fault towards him, that he cast away his shield, and heeding\nno strokes, first brake his sword in the press, and then, getting hold of\na great axe, smote at all before him as though none smote at him in turn;\nyea, as though he were smiting down tree-boles for a match against some\nother mighty man; and all the while amidst the hurry, strokes of swords\nand spears rained on him, some falling flatwise and some glancing\nsideways, but some true and square, so that his helm was smitten off and\nhis hauberk rent adown, and point and edge reached his living flesh; and\nhe had thrust himself so far amidst the foe that none could follow to\nshield him, so that at last he fell shattered and rent at the foot of the\nnew clayey wall cast up by the Romans, even as Thiodolf and a band with\nhim came cleaving the press, and the Romans closed the barriers against\nfriend and foe, and cast great beams adown, and masses of iron and lead\nand copper taken from the smithying-booths of the Wolfings, to stay them\nif it were but a little.\n\nThen Thiodolf bestrode the fallen warrior, and men of his House were\nclose behind him, for wisely had he fought, cleaving the press like a\nwedge, helping his friends that they might help him, so that they all\nwent forward together.  But when he saw Arinbiorn fall he cried out:\n\n\"Woe's me, Arinbiorn! that thou wouldest not wait for me; for the day is\nyoung yet, and over-young!\"\n\nThere then they cleared the space outside the gate, and lifted up the\nBearing Warrior, and bare him back from the rampart.  For so fierce had\nbeen the fight and so eager the storm of those that had followed after\nhim that they must needs order their battle afresh, since Thiodolf's\nwedge which he had driven into the Roman host was but of a few and the\nfoe had been many and the rampart and the shot-weapons were close anigh.\nWise therefore it seemed to abide them of the second battle and join with\nthem to swarm over the new-built slippery wall in the teeth of the Roman\nshot.\n\nIn this, the first onset of the Morning Battle, some of the Markmen had\nfallen, but not many, since but a few had entered outright into the Roman\nranks; and when they first rushed on from the wood but three of them were\nslain, and the slaughter was all of the dastards and the Romans; and\nafterwards not a few of the Romans were slain, what by Arinbiorn, what by\nthe others; for they were fighting fleeing, and before their eyes was the\nimage of the garth-gate which was behind them; and they stumbled against\neach other as they were driven sideways against the onrush of the Goths,\nnor were they now standing fair and square to them, and they were hurried\nand confused with the dread of the onset of them of the two Marks.\n\nAs yet Thiodolf had gotten no great hurt, so that when he heard that\nArinbiorn's soul had passed away he smiled and said:\n\n\"Yea, yea, Arinbiorn might have abided the end, for ere then shall the\nbattle be hard.\"\n\nSo now the Wolfings and the Bearings met joyously the kindreds of the\nNether Mark and the others of the second battle, and they sang the song\nof victory arrayed in good order hard by the Roman rampart, while\nbowstrings twanged and arrows whistled, and sling-stones hummed from this\nside and from that.\n\nAnd of their song of victory thus much the tale telleth:\n\n      \"Now hearken and hear\n      Of the day-dawn of fear,\n      And how up rose the sun\n      On the battle begun.\n      All night lay a-hiding,\n      Our anger abiding,\n      Dark down in the wood\n      The sharp seekers of blood;\n   But ere red grew the heaven we bore them all bare,\n   For against us undriven the foemen must fare;\n   They sought and they found us, and sorrowed to find,\n   For the tree-boles around us the story shall mind,\n   How fast from the glooming they fled to the light,\n   Yeasaying the dooming of Tyr of the fight.\n\n      \"Hearken yet and again\n      How the night gan to wane,\n      And the twilight stole on\n      Till the world was well won!\n      E'en in such wise was wending\n      A great host for our ending;\n      On our life-days e'en so\n      Stole the host of the foe;\n   Till the heavens grew lighter, and light grew the world,\n   And the storm of the fighter upon them was hurled,\n   Then some fled the stroke, and some died and some stood,\n   Till the worst of the storm broke right out from the wood,\n   And the war-shafts were singing the carol of fear,\n   The tale of the bringing the sharp swords anear.\n\n      \"Come gather we now,\n      For the day doth grow.\n      Come, gather, ye bold,\n      Lest the day wax old;\n      Lest not till to-morrow\n      We slake our sorrow,\n      And heap the ground\n      With many a mound.\n   Come, war-children, gather, and clear we the land!\n   In the tide of War-father the deed is to hand.\n   Clad in gear that we gilded they shrink from our sword;\n   In the House that we builded they sit at the board;\n   Come, war-children, gather, come swarm o'er the wall\n   For the feast of War-father to sweep out the Hall!\"\n\nNow amidst of their singing the sun rose upon the earth, and gleamed in\nthe arms of men, and lit the faces of the singing warriors as they stood\nturned toward the east.\n\nIn this first onset of battle but twenty and three Markmen were slain in\nall, besides Arinbiorn; for, as aforesaid, they had the foe at a\ndisadvantage.  And this onset is called in the tale the Storm of Dawning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--OF THIODOLF'S STORM\n\n\nThe Goths tarried not over their victory; they shot with all the bowmen\nthat they had against the Romans on the wall, and therewith arrayed\nthemselves to fall on once more.  And Thiodolf, now that the foe were\ncovered by a wall, though it was but a little one, sent a message to the\nmen of the third battle, them of Up-mark to wit, to come forward in good\narray and help to make a ring around the Wolfing Stead, wherein they\nshould now take the Romans as a beast is taken in a trap.  Meanwhile,\nuntil they came, he sent other men to the wood to bring tree-boles to\nbatter the gate, and to make bridges whereby to swarm over the wall,\nwhich was but breast-high on the Roman side, though they had worked at it\nceaselessly since yesterday morning.\n\nIn a long half-hour, therefore, the horns of the men of Up-mark sounded,\nand they came forth from the wood a very great company, for with them\nalso were the men of the stay-at-homes and the homeless, such of them as\nwere fit to bear arms.  Amongst these went the Hall-Sun surrounded by a\nband of the warriors of Up-mark; and before her was borne her namesake\nthe Lamp as a sign of assured victory.  But these stay-at-homes with the\nHall-Sun were stayed by the command of Thiodolf on the crown of the slope\nabove the dwellings, and stood round about the Speech-Hill, on the\ntopmost of which stood the Hall-Sun, and the wondrous Lamp, and the men\nwho warded her and it.\n\nWhen the Romans saw the new host come forth from the wood, they might\nwell think that they would have work enough to do that day; but when they\nsaw the Hall-Sun take her stand on the Speech-Hill with the men-at-arms\nabout her, and the Lamp before her, then dread of the Gods fell upon\nthem, and they knew that the doom had gone forth against them.\nNevertheless they were not men to faint and die because the Gods were\nbecome their foes, but they were resolved rather to fight it out to the\nend against whatsoever might come against them, as was well seen\nafterwards.\n\nNow they had made four gates to their garth according to their custom,\nand at each gate within was there a company of their mightiest men, and\neach was beset by the best of the Markmen.  Thiodolf and his men beset\nthe western gate where they had made that fierce onset.  And the northern\ngate was beset by the Elkings and some of the kindreds of the\nNether-mark; and the eastern gate by the rest of the men of Nether-mark;\nand the southern gate by the kindreds of Up-mark.\n\nAll this the Romans noted, and they saw how that the Markmen were now\nvery many, and they knew that they were men no less valiant than\nthemselves, and they perceived that Thiodolf was a wise Captain; and in\nless than two hours' space from the Storm of Dawning they saw those men\ncoming from the wood with plenteous store of tree-trunks to bridge their\nditch and rampart; and they considered how the day was yet very young, so\nthat they might look for no shelter from the night-tide; and as for any\naid from their own folk at the war-garth aforesaid, they hoped not for\nit, nor had they sent any messenger to the Captain of the garth; nor did\nthey know as yet of his overthrow on the Ridge.\n\nNow therefore there seemed to be but two choices before them; either to\nabide within the rampart they had cast up, or to break out like valiant\nmen, and either die in the storm, or cleave a way through, whereby they\nmight come to their kindred and their stronghold south-east of the Mark.\n\nThis last way then they chose; or, to say the truth, it was their chief\ncaptain who chose it for them, though they were nothing loth thereto: for\nthis man was a mocker, yet hot-headed, unstable, and nought wise in war,\nand heretofore had his greed minished his courage; yet now, being driven\ninto a corner, he had courage enough and to spare, but utterly lacked\npatience; for it had been better for the Romans to have abided one or two\nonsets from the Goths, whereby they who should make the onslaught would\nat the least have lost more men than they on whom they should fall,\nbefore they within stormed forth on them; but their pride took away from\nthe Romans their last chance.  But their captain, now that he perceived,\nas he thought, that the game was lost and his life come to its last hour\nwherein he would have to leave his treasure and pleasure behind him, grew\ndesperate and therewith most fierce and cruel.  So all the captives whom\nthey had taken (they were but two score and two, for the wounded men they\nhad slain) he caused to be bound on the chairs of the high-seat clad in\ntheir war-gear with their swords or spears made fast to their right\nhands, and their shields to their left hands; and he said that the Goths\nshould now hold a Thing wherein they should at last take counsel wisely,\nand abstain from folly.  For he caused store of faggots and small wood\nsmeared with grease and oil to be cast into the hall that it might be\nfired, so that it and the captives should burn up altogether; \"So,\" said\nhe, \"shall we have a fair torch for our funeral fire;\" for it was the\ncustom of the Romans to burn their dead.\n\nThus, then, he did; and then he caused men to do away the barriers and\nopen all the four gates of the new-made garth, after he had manned the\nwall with the slingers and bowmen, and slain the horses, so that the\nwoodland folk should have no gain of them.  Then he arrayed his men at\nthe gates and about them duly and wisely, and bade those valiant footmen\nfall on the Goths who were getting ready to fall on them, and to do their\nbest.  But he himself armed at all points took his stand at the Man's-\ndoor of the Hall, and swore by all the Gods of his kindred that he would\nnot move a foot's length from thence either for fire or for steel.\n\nSo fiercely on that fair morning burned the hatred of men about the\ndwellings of the children of the Wolf of the Goths, wherein the children\nof the Wolf of Rome were shut up as in a penfold of slaughter.\n\nMeanwhile the Hall-Sun standing on the Hill of Speech beheld it all,\nlooking down into the garth of war; for the new wall was no hindrance to\nher sight, because the Speech-Hill was high and but a little way from the\nGreat Roof; and indeed she was within shot of the Roman bowmen, though\nthey were not very deft in shooting.\n\nSo now she lifted up her voice and sang so that many heard her; for at\nthis moment of time there was a lull in the clamour of battle both within\nthe garth and without; even as it happens when the thunder-storm is just\nabout to break on the world, that the wind drops dead, and the voice of\nthe leaves is hushed before the first great and near flash of lightening\nglares over the fields.\n\nSo she sang:\n\n   \"Now the latest hour cometh and the ending of the strife;\n   And to-morrow and to-morrow shall we take the hand of life,\n   And wend adown the meadows, and skirt the darkling wood,\n   And reap the waving acres, and gather in the good.\n   I see a wall before me built up of steel and fire,\n   And hurts and heart-sick striving, and the war-wright's fierce desire;\n   But there-amidst a door is, and windows are therein;\n   And the fair sun-litten meadows and the Houses of the kin\n   Smile on me through the terror my trembling life to stay,\n   That at my mouth now flutters, as fain to flee away.\n   Lo e'en as the little hammer and the blow-pipe of the wright\n   About the flickering fire deals with the silver white,\n   And the cup and its beauty groweth that shall be for the people's\n   feast,\n   And all men are glad to see it from the greatest to the least;\n   E'en so is the tale now fashioned, that many a time and oft\n   Shall be told on the acre's edges, when the summer eve is soft;\n   Shall be hearkened round the hall-blaze when the mid-winter night\n   The kindreds' mirth besetteth, and quickeneth man's delight,\n   And we that have lived in the story shall be born again and again\n   As men feast on the bread of our earning, and praise the grief-born\n   grain.\"\n\nAs she made an end of singing, those about her understood her words, that\nshe was foretelling victory, and the peace of the Mark, and for joy they\nraised a shrill cry; and the warriors who were nighest to her took it up,\nand it spread through the whole host round about the garth, and went up\ninto the breath of the summer morning and went down the wind along the\nmeadow of the Wolfings, so that they of the wain-burg, who were now\ndrawing somewhat near to Wolf-stead heard it and were glad.\n\nBut the Romans when they heard it knew that the heart of the battle was\nreached, and they cast back that shout wrathfully and fiercely, and made\ntoward the foe.\n\nTherewithal those mighty men fell on each other in the narrow passes of\nthe garth; for fear was dead and buried in that Battle of the Morning.\n\nOn the North gate Hiarandi of the Elkings was the point of the Markmen's\nwedge, and first clave the Roman press.  In the Eastern gate it was\nValtyr, Otter's brother's son, a young man and most mighty.  In the South\ngate it was Geirbald of the Shieldings, the Messenger.\n\nIn the west gate Thiodolf the War-duke gave one mighty cry like the roar\nof an angry lion, and cleared a space before him for the wielding of\nIvar's blade; for at that moment he had looked up to the Roof of the\nKindred and had beheld a little stream of smoke curling blue out of a\nwindow thereof, and he knew what had betided, and how short was the time\nbefore them.  But his wrathful cry was taken up by some who had beheld\nthat same sight, and by others who saw nought but the Roman press, and\nterribly it rang over the swaying struggling crowd.\n\nThen fell the first rank of the Romans before those stark men and mighty\nwarriors; and they fell even where they stood, for on neither side could\nany give back but for a little space, so close the press was, and the men\nso eager to smite.  Neither did any crave peace if he were hurt or\ndisarmed; for to the Goths it was but a little thing to fall in hot blood\nin that hour of love of the kindred, and longing for the days to be.  And\nfor the Romans, they had had no mercy, and now looked for none: and they\nremembered their dealings with the Goths, and saw before them, as it\nwere, once more, yea, as in a picture, their slayings and quellings, and\nlashings, and cold mockings which they had dealt out to the conquered\nfoemen without mercy, and now they longed sore for the quiet of the dark,\nwhen their hard lives should be over, and all these deeds forgotten, and\nthey and their bitter foes should be at rest for ever.\n\nMost valiantly they fought; but the fury of their despair could not deal\nwith the fearless hope of the Goths, and as rank after rank of them took\nthe place of those who were hewn down by Thiodolf and the Kindred, they\nfell in their turn, and slowly the Goths cleared a space within the\ngates, and then began to spread along the wall within, and grew thicker\nand thicker.  Nor did they fight only at the gates; but made them bridges\nof those tree-trunks, and fell to swarming over the rampart, till they\nhad cleared it of the bowmen and slingers, and then they leaped down and\nfell upon the flanks of the Romans; and the host of the dead grew, and\nthe host of the living lessened.\n\nMoreover the stay-at-homes round about the Speech-Hill, and that band of\nthe warriors of Up-mark who were with them, beheld the Great Roof and saw\nthe smoke come gushing out of the windows, and at last saw the red flames\ncreep out amidst it and waver round the window jambs like little banners\nof scarlet cloth.  Then they could no longer refrain themselves, but ran\ndown from the Speech-Hill and the slope about it with great and fierce\ncries, and clomb the wall where it was unmanned, helping each other with\nhand and back, both stark warriors, and old men and lads and women: and\nthus they gat them into the garth and fell upon the lessening band of the\nRomans, who now began to give way hither and thither about the garth, as\nthey best might.\n\nThus it befell at the West-gate, but at the other gates it was no worser,\nfor there was no diversity of valour between the Houses; nay, whereas the\nmore part and the best part of the Romans faced the onset of Thiodolf,\nwhich seemed to them the main onset, they were somewhat easier to deal\nwith elsewhere than at the West gate; and at the East gate was the place\nfirst won, so that Valtyr and his folk were the first to clear a space\nwithin the gate, and to tell the tale shortly (for can this that and the\nother sword-stroke be told of in such a medley?) they drew the death-ring\naround the Romans that were before them, and slew them all to the last\nman, and then fell fiercely on the rearward of them of the North gate,\nwho still stood before Hiarandi's onset.  There again was no long tale to\ntell of, for Hiarandi was just winning the gate, and the wall was cleared\nof the Roman shot-fighters, and the Markmen were standing on the top\nthereof, and casting down on the Romans spears and baulks of wood and\nwhatsoever would fly.  There again were the Romans all slain or put out\nof the fight, and the two bands of the kindred joined together, and with\nwhat voices the battle-rage had left them cried out for joy and fared on\ntogether to help to bind the sheaves of war which Thiodolf's sickle had\nreaped.  And now it was mere slaying, and the Romans, though they still\nfought in knots of less than a score, yet fought on and hewed and thrust\nwithout more thought or will than the stone has when it leaps adown the\nhill-side after it has first been set agoing.\n\nBut now the garth was fairly won and Thiodolf saw that there was no hope\nfor the Romans drawing together again; so while the kindreds were busied\nin hewing down those knots of desperate men, he gathered to him some of\nthe wisest of his warriors, amongst whom were Steinulf and Grani the\nGrey, the deft wood-wrights (but Athalulf had been grievously hurt by a\nspear and was out of the battle), and drave a way through the confused\nturmoil which still boiled in the garth there, and made straight for the\nMan's-door of the Hall.  Soon he was close thereto, having hewn away all\nfleers that hindered him, and the doorway was before him.  But on the\nthreshold, the fire and flames of the kindled hall behind him, stood the\nRoman Captain clad in gold-adorned armour and surcoat of sea-born purple;\nthe man was cool and calm and proud, and a mocking smile was on his face:\nand he bore his bright blade unbloodied in his hand.\n\nThiodolf stayed a moment of time, and their eyes met; it had gone hard\nwith the War-duke, and those eyes glittered in his pale face, and his\nteeth were close set together; though he had fought wisely, and for life,\nas he who is most valiant ever will do, till he is driven to bay like the\nlone wood-wolf by the hounds, yet had he been sore mishandled.  His helm\nand shield were gone, his hauberk rent; for it was no dwarf-wrought coat,\nbut the work of Ivar's hand: the blood was running down from his left\narm, and he was hurt in many places: he had broken Ivar's sword in the\nmedley, and now bore in his hand a strong Roman short-sword, and his feet\nstood bloody on the worn earth anigh the Man's-door.\n\nHe looked into the scornful eyes of the Roman lord for a little minute\nand then laughed aloud, and therewithal, leaping on him with one spring,\nturned sideways, and dealt him a great buffet on his ear with his unarmed\nleft hand, just as the Roman thrust at him with his sword, so that the\nCaptain staggered forward on to the next man following, which was\nWolfkettle the eager warrior, who thrust him through with his sword and\nshoved him aside as they all strode into the hall together.  Howbeit no\nsword fell from the Roman Captain as he fell, for Thiodolf's side bore it\ninto the Hall of the Wolfings.\n\nMost wrathful were those men, and went hastily, for their Roof was full\nof smoke, and the flames flickered about the pillars and the wall here\nand there, and crept up to the windows aloft; yet was it not wholly or\nfiercely burning; for the Roman fire-raisers had been hurried and hasty\nin their work.  Straightway then Steinulf and Grani led the others off at\na run towards the loft and the water; but Thiodolf, who went slowly and\npainfully, looked and beheld on the dais those men bound for the burning,\nand he went quietly, and as a man who has been sick, and is weak, up on\nto the dais, and said:\n\n\"Be of good cheer, O brothers, for the kindreds have vanquished the\nfoemen, and the end of strife is come.\"\n\nHis voice sounded strange and sweet to them amidst the turmoil of the\nfight without; he laid down his sword on the table, and drew a little\nsharp knife from his girdle and cut their bonds one by one and loosed\nthem with his blood-stained hands; and each one as he loosed him he\nkissed and said to him, \"Brother, go help those who are quenching the\nfire; this is the bidding of the War-duke.\"\n\nBut as he loosed one after other he was longer and longer about it, and\nhis words were slower.  At last he came to the man who was bound in his\nown high-seat close under the place of the wondrous Lamp, the Hall-Sun,\nand he was the only one left bound; that man was of the Wormings and was\nnamed Elfric; he loosed him and was long about it; and when he was done\nhe smiled on him and kissed him, and said to him:\n\n\"Arise, brother! go help the quenchers of the fire, and leave to me this\nmy chair, for I am weary: and if thou wilt, thou mayst bring me of that\nwater to drink, for this morning men have forgotten the mead of the\nreapers!\"\n\nThen Elfric arose, and Thiodolf sat in his chair, and leaned back his\nhead; but Elfric looked at him for a moment as one scared, and then ran\nhis ways down the hall, which now was growing noisy with the hurry and\nbustle of the quenchers of the fire, to whom had divers others joined\nthemselves.\n\nThere then from a bucket which was still for a moment he filled a wooden\nbowl, which he caught up from the base of one of the hall-pillars, and\nhastened up the Hall again; and there was no man nigh the dais, and\nThiodolf yet sat in his chair, and the hall was dim with the rolling\nsmoke, and Elfric saw not well what the War-duke was doing.  So he\nhastened on, and when he was close to Thiodolf he trod in something wet,\nand his heart sank for he knew that it was blood; his foot slipped\ntherewith and as he put out his hand to save himself the more part of the\nwater was spilled, and mingled with the blood.  But he went up to\nThiodolf and said to him, \"Drink, War-duke! here hath come a mouthful of\nwater.\"\n\nBut Thiodolf moved not for his word, and Elfric touched him, and he moved\nnone the more.\n\nThen Elfric's heart failed him and he laid his hand on the War-duke's\nhand, and looked closely into his face; and the hand was cold and the\nface ashen-pale; and Elfric laid his hand on his side, and he felt the\nshort-sword of the Roman leader thrust deep therein, besides his many\nother hurts.\n\nSo Elfric knew that he was dead, and he cast the bowl to the earth, and\nlifted up his hands and wailed out aloud, like a woman who hath come\nsuddenly on her dead child, and cried out in a great voice:\n\n\"Hither, hither, O men in this hall, for the War-duke of the Markmen is\ndead!  O ye people, Hearken!  Thiodolf the Mighty, the Wolfing is dead!\"\n\nAnd he was a young man, and weak with the binding and the waiting for\ndeath, and he bowed himself adown and crouched on the ground and wept\naloud.\n\nBut even as he cried that cry, the sunlight outside the Man's-door was\ndarkened, and the Hall-Sun came over the threshold in her ancient gold-\nembroidered raiment, holding in her hand her namesake the wondrous Lamp;\nand the spears and the war-gear of warriors gleamed behind her; but the\nmen tarried on the threshold till she turned about and beckoned to them,\nand then they poured in through the Man's-door, their war-gear rent and\nthey all befouled and disarrayed with the battle, but with proud and\nhappy faces: as they entered she waved her hand to them to bid them go\njoin the quenchers of the fire; so they went their ways.\n\nBut she went with unfaltering steps up to the dais, and the place where\nthe chain of the Lamp hung down from amidst the smoke-cloud wavering a\nlittle in the gusts of the hall.  Straightway she made the Lamp fast to\nits chain, and dealt with its pulleys with a deft hand often practised\ntherein, and then let it run up toward the smoke-hidden Roof till it\ngleamed in its due place once more, a token of the salvation of the\nWolfings and the welfare of all the kindreds.\n\nThen she turned toward Thiodolf with a calm and solemn face, though it\nwas very pale and looked as if she would not smile again.  Elfric had\nrisen up and was standing by the board speechless and the passion of sobs\nstill struggling in his bosom.  She put him aside gently, and went up to\nThiodolf and stood above him, and looked down on his face a while: then\nshe put forth her hand and closed his eyes, and stooped down and kissed\nhis face.  Then she stood up again and faced the Hall and looked and saw\nthat many were streaming in, and that though the smoke was still eddying\noverhead, the fire was well nigh quenched within; and without the sound\nof battle had sunk and died away.  For indeed the Markmen had ended their\nday's work before noon-tide that day, and the more part of the Romans\nwere slain, and to the rest they had given peace till the Folk-mote\nshould give Doom concerning them; for pity of these valiant men was\ngrowing in the hearts of the valiant men who had vanquished them, now\nthat they feared them no more.\n\nAnd this second part of the Morning Battle is called Thiodolf's Storm.\n\nSo now when the Hall-Sun looked and beheld that the battle was done and\nthe fire quenched, and when she saw how every man that came into the Hall\nlooked up and beheld the wondrous Lamp and his face quickened into joy at\nthe sight of it; and how most looked up at the high-seat and Thiodolf\nlying leaned back therein, her heart nigh broke between the thought of\nher grief and of the grief of the Folk that their mighty friend was dead,\nand the thought of the joy of the days to be and all the glory that his\nlatter days had won.  But she gathered heart, and casting back the dark\ntresses of her hair, she lifted up her voice and cried out till its clear\nshrillness sounded throughout all the Roof:\n\n\"O men in this Hall the War-duke is dead!  O people hearken! for Thiodolf\nthe Mighty hath changed his life: Come hither, O men, Come hither, for\nthis is true, that Thiodolf is dead!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX--THIODOLF IS BORNE OUT OF THE HALL AND OTTER IS LAID BESIDE\nHIM\n\n\nSo when they heard her voice they came thither flockmeal, and a great\nthrong mingled of many kindreds was in the Hall, but with one consent\nthey made way for the Children of the Wolf to stand nearest to the dais.\nSo there they stood, the warriors mingled with the women, the swains with\nthe old men, the freemen with the thralls: for now the stay-at-homes of\nthe House were all gotten into the garth, and the more part of them had\nflowed into the feast-hall when they knew that the fire was slackening.\n\nAll these now had heard the clear voice of the Hall-Sun, or others had\ntold them what had befallen; and the wave of grief had swept coldly over\nthem amidst their joy of the recoverance of their dwelling-place; yet\nthey would not wail nor cry aloud, even to ease their sorrow, till they\nhad heard the words of the Hall-Sun, as she stood facing them beside\ntheir dead War-duke.\n\nThen she spake: \"O Sorli the Old, come up hither! thou hast been my\nfellow in arms this long while.\"\n\nSo the old man came forth, and went slowly in his clashing war-gear up on\nto the dais.  But his attire gleamed and glittered, since over-old was he\nto thrust deep into the press that day, howbeit he was wise in war.  So\nhe stood beside her on the dais holding his head high, and proud he\nlooked, for all his thin white locks and sunken eyes.\n\nBut again said the Hall-Sun: \"Canst thou hear me, Wolfkettle, when I bid\nthee stand beside me, or art thou, too, gone on the road to Valhall?\"\n\nForth then strode that mighty warrior and went toward the dais: nought\nfair was his array to look on; for point and edge had rent it and stained\nit red, and the flaring of the hall-flames had blackened it; his face was\nstreaked with black withal, and his hands were as the hands of a smith\namong the thralls who hath wrought unwashen in the haste and hurry when\nmen look to see the war-arrow abroad.  But he went up on to the dais and\nheld up his head proudly, and looked forth on to the hall-crowd with eyes\nthat gleamed fiercely from his stained and blackened face.\n\nAgain the Hall-Sun said: \"Art thou also alive, O Egil the messenger?\nSwift are thy feet, but not to flee from the foe: Come up and stand with\nus!\"\n\nTherewith Egil clave the throng; he was not so roughly dealt with as was\nWolfkettle, for he was a bowman, and had this while past shot down on the\nRomans from aloof; and he yet held his bended bow in his hand.  He also\ncame up on to the dais and stood beside Wolfkettle glancing down on the\nhall-crowd, looking eagerly from side to side.\n\nYet again the Hall-Sun spake: \"No aliens now are dwelling in the Mark;\ncome hither, ye men of the kindreds!  Come thou, our brother Hiarandi of\nthe Elkings, for thy sisters, our wives, are fain of thee.  Come thou,\nValtyr of the Laxings, brother's son of Otter; do thou for the War-duke\nwhat thy father's brother had done, had he not been faring afar.  Come\nthou, Geirbald of the Shieldings the messenger!  Now know we the deeds of\nothers and thy deeds.  Come, stand beside us for a little!\"\n\nForth then they came in their rent and battered war-gear: and the tall\nHiarandi bore but the broken truncheon of his sword; and Valtyr a\nwoodman's axe notched and dull with work; and Geirbald a Roman\ncast-spear, for his own weapons had been broken in the medley; and he\ncame the last of the three, going as a belated reaper from the acres.\nThere they stood by the others and gazed adown the hall-throng.\n\nBut the Hall-Sun spake again: \"Agni of the Daylings, I see thee now.  How\ncamest thou into the hard handplay, old man?  Come hither and stand with\nus, for we love thee.  Angantyr of the Bearings, fair was thy riding on\nthe day of the Battle on the Ridge!  Come thou, be with us.  Shall the\nBeamings whose daughters we marry fail the House of the Wolf to-day?\nGeirodd, thou hast no longer a weapon, but the fight is over, and this\nhour thou needest it not.  Come to us, brother!  Gunbald of the Vallings,\nthe Falcon on thy shield is dim with the dint of point and edge, but it\nhath done its work to ward thy valiant heart: Come hither, friend!  Come\nall ye and stand with us!\"\n\nAs she named them so they came, and they went up on to the dais and stood\naltogether; and a terrible band of warriors they looked had the fight\nbeen to begin over again, and they to meet death once more.  And again\nspake the Hall-Sun:\n\n\"Steinulf and Grani, deft are your hands!  Take ye the stalks of the war\nblossoms, the spears of the kindreds, and knit them together to make a\nbier for our War-duke, for he is weary and may not go afoot.  Thou Ali,\nson of Grey; thou hast gone errands for me before; go forth now from the\ngarth, and wend thy ways toward the water, and tell me when thou comest\nback what thou hast seen of the coming of the wain-burg.  For by this\ntime it should be drawing anigh.\"\n\nSo Ali went forth, and there was silence of words for a while in the\nHall; but there arose the sound of the wood-wrights busy with the wimble\nand the hammer about the bier.  No long space had gone by when Ali came\nback into the hall panting with his swift running; and he cried out:\n\n\"O Hall-Sun, they are coming; the last wain hath crossed the ford, and\nthe first is hard at hand: bright are their banners in the sun.\"\n\nThen said the Hall-Sun: \"O warriors, it is fitting that we go to meet our\nbanners returning from the field, and that we do the Gods to wit what\ndeeds we have done; fitting is it also that Thiodolf our War-duke wend\nwith us.  Now get ye into your ordered bands, and go we forth from the\nfire-scorched hall, and out into the sunlight, that the very earth and\nthe heavens may look upon the face of our War-duke, and bear witness that\nhe hath played his part as a man.\"\n\nThen without more words the folk began to stream out of the Hall, and\nwithin the garth which the Romans had made they arrayed their companies.\nBut when they were all gone from the Hall save they who were on the dais,\nthe Hall-Sun took the waxen torch which she had litten and quenched at\nthe departure of the host to battle, and now she once more kindled it at\nthe flame of the wondrous Lamp, the Hall-Sun.  But the wood-wrights\nbrought the bier which they had made of the spear-shafts of the kindred,\nand they laid thereon a purple cloak gold-embroidered of the treasure of\nthe Wolfings, and thereon was Thiodolf laid.\n\nThen those men took him up; to wit, Sorli the Old, and Wolfkettle and\nEgil, all these were of the Wolfing House; Hiarandi of the Elkings also,\nand Valtyr of the Laxings, Geirbald of the Shieldings, Agni of the\nDaylings, Angantyr of the Bearings, Geirodd of the Beamings, Gunbald of\nthe Vallings: all these, with the two valiant wood-wrights, Steinulf and\nGrani, laid hand to the bier.\n\nSo they bore it down from the dais, and out at the Man's-door into the\nsunlight, and the Hall-Sun followed close after it, holding in her hand\nthe Candle of Returning.  It was an hour after high-noon of a bright\nmidsummer day when she came out into the garth; and the smoke from the\nfire-scorched hall yet hung about the trees of the wood-edge.  She looked\nneither down towards her feet nor on the right side or the left, but\nstraight before her.  The ordered companies of the kindreds hid the sight\nof many fearful things from her eyes; though indeed the thralls and women\nhad mostly gleaned the dead from the living both of friend and foe, and\nwere tending the hurt of either host.  Through an opening in the ranks\nmoreover could they by the bier behold the scanty band of Roman captives,\nsome standing up, looking dully around them, some sitting or lying on the\ngrass talking quietly together, and it seemed by their faces that for\nthem the bitterness of death was passed.\n\nForth then fared the host by the West gate, where Thiodolf had done so\nvaliantly that day, and out on to the green amidst the booths and lesser\ndwellings.  Sore then was the heart of the Hall-Sun, as she looked forth\nover dwelling, and acre, and meadow, and the blue line of the woods\nbeyond the water, and bethought her of all the familiar things that were\nwithin the compass of her eyesight, and remembered the many days of her\nfather's loving-kindness, and the fair words wherewith he had solaced her\nlife-days.  But of the sorrow that wrung her heart nothing showed in her\nface, nor was she paler now than her wont was.  For high was her courage,\nand she would in no wise mar that fair day and victory of the kindreds\nwith grief for what was gone, whereas so much of what once was, yet\nabided and should abide for ever.\n\nThen fared they down through the acres, where what was yet left of the\nwheat was yellowing toward harvest, and the rye hung grey and heavy; for\nbright and hot had the weather been all through these tidings.  Howbeit\nmuch of the corn was spoiled by the trampling of the Roman bands.\n\nSo came they into the fair open meadow and saw before them the wains\ncoming to meet them with their folk; to wit a throng of stout carles of\nthe thrall-folk led by the war-wise and ripe men of the Steerings.  Bright\nwas the gleaming of the banner-wains, though for the lack of wind the\nbanners hung down about their staves; the sound of the lowing of the\nbulls and the oxen, the neighing of horses and bleating of the flocks\ncame up to the ears of the host as they wended over the meadow.\n\nThey made stay at last on the rising ground, all trampled and in parts\nbloody, where yesterday Thiodolf had come on the fight between the\nremnant of Otter's men and the Romans: there they opened their ranks, and\nmade a ring round about a space, amidmost of which was a little mound\nwhereon was set the bier of Thiodolf.  The wains and their warders came\nup with them and drew a garth of the wains round about the ring of men\nwith the banners of the kindreds in their due places.\n\nThere was the Wolf and the Elk, the Falcon, the Swan, the Boar, the Bear,\nand the Green-tree: the Willow-bush, the Gedd, the Water-bank and the\nWood-Ousel, the Steer, the Mallard and the Roe-deer: all these were of\nthe Mid-mark.  But of the Upper-mark were the Horse and the Spear, and\nthe Shield, and the Daybreak, and the Dale, and the Mountain, and the\nBrook, and the Weasel, and the Cloud, and the Hart.\n\nOf the Nether-mark were the Salmon, and the Lynx, and the Ling worm, the\nSeal, the Stone, and the Sea-mew; the Buck-goat, the Apple-tree, the\nBull, the Adder, and the Crane.\n\nThere they stood in the hot sunshine three hours after noon; and a little\nwind came out of the west and raised the pictured cloths upon the banner-\nstaves, so that the men could now see the images of the tokens of their\nHouses and the Fathers of old time.\n\nNow was there silence in the ring of men; but it opened presently and\nthrough it came all-armed warriors bearing another bier, and lo, Otter\nupon it, dead in his war-gear with many a grievous wound upon his body.\nFor men had found him in an ingle of the wall of the Great Roof, where he\nhad been laid yesterday by the Romans when his company and the Bearings\nwith the Wormings made their onset: for the Romans had noted his\nexceeding valour, and when they had driven off the Goths some of them\nbrought him dead inside their garth, for they would know the name and\ndignity of so valorous a man.\n\nSo now they bore him to the mound where Thiodolf lay and set the bier\ndown beside Thiodolf's, and the two War-dukes of the Markmen lay there\ntogether: and when the warriors beheld that sight, they could not\nforbear, but some groaned aloud, and some wept great tears, and they\nclashed their swords on their shields and the sound of their sorrow and\ntheir praise went up to the summer heavens.\n\nNow the Hall-Sun holding aloft the waxen torch lifted up her voice and\nsaid:\n\n   \"O warriors of the Wolfings, by the token of the flame\n   That here in my right hand flickers, ye are back at the House of the\n   Name,\n   And there yet burneth the Hall-Sun beneath the Wolfing Roof,\n   And the flame that the foemen quickened hath died out far aloof.\n   Ye gleanings of the battle, lift up your hearts on high,\n   For the House of the War-wise Wolfings and the Folk undoomed to die.\n   But ye kindreds of the Markmen, the Wolfing guests are ye,\n   And to-night we hold the high-tide, and great shall the feasting be,\n   For to-day by the road that we know not a many wend their ways\n   To the Gods and the ancient Fathers, and the hope of the latter days.\n   And how shall their feet be cumbered if we tangle them with woe,\n   And the heavy rain of sorrow drift o'er the road they go?\n   They have toiled, and their toil was troublous to make the days to\n   come;\n   Use ye their gifts in gladness, lest they grieve for the Ancient Home!\n   Now are our maids arraying that fire-scorched Hall of ours\n   With the treasure of the Wolfings and the wealth of summer flowers,\n   And this eve the work before you will be the Hall to throng\n   And purge its walls of sorrow and quench its scathe and wrong.\"\n\nShe looked on the dead Thiodolf a moment, and then glanced from him to\nOtter and spake again:\n\n   \"O kindreds, here before you two mighty bodies lie;\n   Henceforth no man shall see them in house and field go by\n   As we were used to behold them, familiar to us then\n   As the wind beneath the heavens and the sun that shines on men;\n   Now soon shall there be nothing of their dwelling-place to tell,\n   Save the billow of the meadows, the flower-grown grassy swell!\n   Now therefore, O ye kindreds, if amidst you there be one\n   Who hath known the heart of the War-dukes, and the deeds their hands\n   have done,\n   Will not the word be with him, while yet your hearts are hot,\n   Of our praise and long remembrance, and our love that dieth not?\n   Then let him come up hither and speak the latest word\n   O'er the limbs of the battle-weary and the hearts outworn with the\n   sword.\"\n\nShe held her peace, and there was a stir in the ring of men: for they who\nwere anigh the Dayling banner saw an old warrior sitting on a great black\nhorse and fully armed.  He got slowly off his horse and walked toward the\nring of warriors, which opened before him; for all knew him for Asmund\nthe old, the war-wise warrior of the Daylings, even he who had lamented\nover the Hauberk of Thiodolf.  He had taken horse the day before, and had\nridden toward the battle, but was belated, and had come up with them of\nthe wain-burg just as they had crossed the water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI--OLD ASMUND SPEAKETH OVER THE WAR-DUKES: THE DEAD ARE LAID\nIN MOUND\n\n\nNow while all looked on, he went to the place where lay the bodies of the\nWar-dukes, and looked down on the face of Otter and said:\n\n   \"O Otter, there thou liest! and thou that I knew of old,\n   When my beard began to whiten, as the best of the keen and the bold,\n   And thou wert as my youngest brother, and thou didst lead my sons\n   When we fared forth over the mountains to meet the arrowy Huns,\n   And I smiled to see thee teaching the lore that I learned thee erst.\n   O Otter, dost thou remember how the Goth-folk came by the worst,\n   And with thee in mine arms I waded the wide shaft-harrowed flood\n   That lapped the feet of the mountains with its water blent with blood;\n   And how in the hollow places of the mountains hidden away\n   We abode the kindreds' coming as the wet night bideth day?\n   Dost thou remember, Otter, how many a joy we had,\n   How many a grief remembered has made our high-tide glad?\n   O fellow of the hall-glee!  O fellow of the field!\n   Why then hast thou departed and left me under shield?\n   I the ancient, I the childless, while yet in the Laxing hall\n   Are thy brother's sons abiding and their children on thee call.\n\n   \"O kindreds of the people! the soul that dwelt herein,\n   This goodly way-worn body, was keen for you to win\n   Good days and long endurance.  Who knoweth of his deed\n   What things for you it hath fashioned from the flame of the fire of\n   need?\n   But of this at least well wot we, that forth from your hearts it came\n   And back to your hearts returneth for the seed of thriving and fame.\n   In the ground wherein ye lay it, the body of this man,\n   No deed of his abideth, no glory that he wan,\n   But evermore the Markmen shall bear his deeds o'er earth,\n   With the joy of the deeds that are coming, the garland of his worth.\"\n\nHe was silent a little as he stood looking down on Otter's face with\ngrievous sorrow, for all that his words were stout.  For indeed, as he\nhad said, Otter had been his battle-fellow and his hall-fellow, though he\nwas much younger than Asmund; and they had been standing foot to foot in\nthat battle wherein old Asmund's sons were slain by his side.\n\nAfter a while he turned slowly from looking at Otter to gaze upon\nThiodolf, and his body trembled as he looked, and he opened his mouth to\nspeak; but no word came from it; and he sat down upon the edge of the\nbier, and the tears began to gush out of his old eyes, and he wept aloud.\nThen they that saw him wondered; for all knew the stoutness of his heart,\nand how he had borne more burdens than that of eld, and had not cowered\ndown under them.  But at last he arose again, and stood firmly on his\nfeet, and faced the folk-mote, and in a voice more like the voice of a\nman in his prime than of an old man, he sang:\n\n      \"Wild the storm is abroad\n      Of the edge of the sword!\n      Far on runneth the path\n      Of the war-stride of wrath!\n      The Gods hearken and hear\n      The long rumour of fear\n      From the meadows beneath\n      Running fierce o'er the heath,\n   Till it beats round their dwelling-place builded aloof\n   And at last all up-swelling breaks wild o'er their roof,\n   And quencheth their laughter and crieth on all,\n   As it rolleth round rafter and beam of the Hall,\n   Like the speech of the thunder-cloud tangled on high,\n   When the mountain-halls sunder as dread goeth by.\n\n      \"So they throw the door wide\n      Of the Hall where they bide,\n      And to murmuring song\n      Turns that voice of the wrong,\n      And the Gods wait a-gaze\n      For that Wearer of Ways:\n      For they know he hath gone\n      A long journey alone.\n   Now his feet are they hearkening, and now is he come,\n   With his battle-wounds darkening the door of his home,\n   Unbyrnied, unshielded, and lonely he stands,\n   And the sword that he wielded is gone from his hands--\n   Hands outstretched and bearing no spoil of the fight,\n   As speechless, unfearing, he stands in their sight.\n\n      \"War-father gleams\n      Where the white light streams\n      Round kings of old\n      All red with gold,\n      And the Gods of the name\n      With joy aflame.\n      All the ancient of men\n      Grown glorious again:\n   Till the Slains-father crieth aloud at the last:\n   'Here is one that belieth no hope of the past!\n   No weapon, no treasure of earth doth he bear,\n   No gift for the pleasure of Godhome to share;\n   But life his hand bringeth, well cherished, most sweet;\n   And hark! the Hall singeth the Folk-wolf to greet!'\n\n      \"As the rain of May\n      On earth's happiest day,\n      So the fair flowers fall\n      On the sun-bright Hall\n      As the Gods rise up\n      With the greeting-cup,\n      And the welcoming crowd\n      Falls to murmur aloud.\n   Then the God of Earth speaketh; sweet-worded he saith,\n   'Lo, the Sun ever seeketh Life fashioned of death;\n   And to-day as he turneth the wide world about\n   On Wolf-stead he yearneth; for there without doubt\n   Dwells the death-fashioned story, the flower of all fame.\n   Come hither new Glory, come Crown of the Name!'\"\n\nAll men's hearts rose high as he sang, and when he had ended arose the\nclang of sword and shield and went ringing down the meadow, and the\nmighty shout of the Markmen's joy rent the heavens: for in sooth at that\nmoment they saw Thiodolf, their champion, sitting among the Gods on his\ngolden chair, sweet savours around him, and sweet sound of singing, and\nhe himself bright-faced and merry as no man on earth had seen him, for as\njoyous a man as he was.\n\nBut when the sound of their exultation sank down, the Hall-Sun spake\nagain:\n\n   \"Now wendeth the sun westward, and weary grows the Earth\n   Of all the long day's doings in sorrow and in mirth;\n   And as the great sun waneth, so doth my candle wane,\n   And its flickering flame desireth to rest and die again.\n   Therefore across the meadows wend we aback once more\n   To the holy Roof of the Wolfings, the shrine of peace and war.\n   And these that once have loved us, these warriors images,\n   Shall sit amidst our feasting, and see, as the Father sees\n   The works that men-folk fashion and the rest of toiling hands,\n   When his eyes look down from the mountains and the heavens above all\n   lands,\n   And up from the flowery meadows and the rolling deeps of the sea.\n   There then at the feast with our champions familiar shall we be\n   As oft we are with the Godfolk, when in story-rhymes and lays\n   We laugh as we tell of their laughter, and their deeds of other days.\n\n   \"Come then, ye sons of the kindreds who hither bore these twain!\n   Take up their beds of glory, and fare we home again,\n   And feast as men delivered from toil unmeet to bear,\n   Who through the night are looking to the dawn-tide fresh and fair\n   And the morn and the noon to follow, and the eve and its morrow morn,\n   All the life of our deliv'rance and the fair days yet unborn.\"\n\nSo she spoke, and a murmur arose as those valiant men came forth again.\nBut lo, now were they dight in fresh and fair raiment and gleaming war-\narray.  For while all this was a-doing and a-saying, they had gotten them\nby the Hall-Sun's bidding unto the wains of their Houses, and had arrayed\nthem from the store therein.\n\nSo now they took up the biers, and the Hall-Sun led them, and they went\nover the meadow before the throng of the kindreds, who followed them duly\nordered, each House about its banner; and when they were come through the\ngarth which the Romans had made to the Man's-door of the Hall, there were\nthe women of the House freshly attired, who cast flowers on the living\nmen of the host, and on the dead War-dukes, while they wept for pity of\nthem.  So went the freemen of the Houses into the Hall, following the\nHall-Sun, and the bearers of the War-dukes; but the banners abode without\nin the garth made by the Romans; and the thralls arrayed a feast for\nthemselves about the wains of the kindreds in the open place before their\ncots and the smithying booths and the byres.\n\nAnd as the Hall-Sun went into the Hall, she thrust down the candle\nagainst the threshold of the Man's-door, and so quenched it.\n\nLong were the kindreds entering, and when they were under the Roof of the\nWolfings, they looked and beheld Thiodolf set in his chair once more, and\nOtter set beside him; and the chiefs and leaders of the House took their\nplaces on the dais, those to whom it was due, and the Hall-Sun sat under\nthe wondrous Lamp her namesake.\n\nNow was the glooming falling upon the earth; but the Hall was bright\nwithin even as the Hall-Sun had promised.  Therein was set forth the\nTreasure of the Wolfings; fair cloths were hung on the walls, goodly\nbroidered garments on the pillars: goodly brazen cauldrons and\nfair-carven chests were set down in nooks where men could see them well,\nand vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the tables of the\nfeast.  The pillars also were wreathed with flowers, and flowers hung\ngarlanded from the walls over the precious hangings; sweet gums and\nspices were burning in fair-wrought censers of brass, and so many candles\nwere alight under the Roof, that scarce had it looked more ablaze when\nthe Romans had litten the faggots therein for its burning amidst the\nhurry of the Morning Battle.\n\nThere then they fell to feasting, hallowing in the high-tide of their\nreturn with victory in their hands: and the dead corpses of Thiodolf and\nOtter, clad in precious glistering raiment, looked down on them from the\nHigh-seat, and the kindreds worshipped them and were glad; and they drank\nthe Cup to them before any others, were they Gods or men.\n\nBut before the feast was hallowed in, came Ali the son of Grey up to the\nHigh-seat, bearing something in his hand: and lo! it was Throng-plough,\nwhich he had sought all over the field where the Markmen had been\novercome by the Romans, and had found it at last.  All men saw him how he\nheld it in his hand now as he went up to the Hall-Sun and spake to her.\nBut she kissed the lad on the forehead, and took Throng-plough, and wound\nthe peace-strings round him and laid him on the board before Thiodolf;\nand then she spake softly as if to herself, yet so that some heard her:\n\n\"O father, no more shalt thou draw Throng-plough from the sheath till the\nbattle is pitched in the last field of fight, and the sons of the\nfruitful Earth and the sons of Day meet Swart and his children at last,\nwhen the change of the World is at hand.  Maybe I shall be with thee\nthen: but now and in meanwhile, farewell, O mighty hand of my father!\"\n\nThus then the Houses of the Mark held their High-tide of Returning under\nthe Wolfing Roof with none to blame them or make them afraid: and the\nmoon rose and the summer night wore on towards dawn, and within the Roof\nand without was there feasting and singing and harping and the voice of\nabundant joyance: for without the Roof feasted the thralls and the\nstrangers, and the Roman war-captives.\n\nBut on the morrow the kindreds laid their dead men in mound betwixt the\nGreat Roof and the Wild-wood.  In one mound they laid them with the War-\ndukes in their midst, and Arinbiorn by Otter's right side; and Thiodolf\nbore Throng-plough to mound with him.\n\nBut a little way from the mound of their own dead, toward the south they\nlaid the Romans, a great company, with their Captain in the midst: and\nthey heaped a long mound over them not right high; so that as years wore,\nand the feet of men and beasts trod it down, it seemed a mere swelling of\nthe earth not made by men's hands; and belike men knew not how many bones\nof valiant men lay beneath; yet it had a name which endured for long, to\nwit, the Battle-toft.\n\nBut the mound whereunder the Markmen were laid was called Thiodolf's Howe\nfor many generations of men, and many are the tales told of him; for men\nwere loth to lose him and forget him: and in the latter days men deemed\nof him that he sits in that Howe not dead but sleeping, with\nThrong-plough laid before him on the board; and that when the sons of the\nGoths are at their sorest need and the falcons cease to sit on the ridge\nof the Great Roof of the Wolfings, he will wake and come forth from the\nHowe for their helping.  But none have dared to break open that Howe and\nbehold what is therein.\n\nBut that swelling of the meadow where the Goths had their overthrow at\nthe hands of the Romans, and Thiodolf fell to earth unwounded, got a name\nalso, and was called the Swooning Knowe; and it kept that name long after\nmen had forgotten wherefore it was so called.\n\nNow when all this was done, and the warriors of the kindreds were\ndeparted each to his own stead, the Wolfings gathered in wheat-harvest,\nand set themselves to make good all that the Romans had undone; and they\ncleansed and mended their Great Roof and made it fairer than before, and\ntook from it all signs of the burning, save that they left the charring\nand marks of the flames on one tie-beam, the second from the dais, for a\ntoken of the past tidings.  Also when Harvest was over the Wolfings, the\nBeamings, the Galtings, and the Elkings, set to work with the Bearings to\nrebuild their Great Roof and the other dwellings and booths which the\nRomans had burned; and right fair was that house.\n\nBut the Wolfings throve in field and fold, and they begat children who\ngrew up to be mighty men and deft of hand, and the House grew more\nglorious year by year.\n\nThe tale tells not that the Romans ever fell on the Mark again; for about\nthis time they began to stay the spreading of their dominion, or even to\ndraw in its boundaries somewhat.\n\nAND THIS IS ALL THAT THE TALE HAS TO TELL CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF THE\nWOLFINGS AND THE KINDREDS OF THE MARK.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n{1}  Welsh with these men means Foreign, and is used for all people of\nEurope who are not of Gothic or Teutonic blood.\n\n{2}  i.e. Foreigners: see note {1}\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HOUSE OF THE WOLFINGS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 2885.txt or 2885.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/8/8/2885\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It was as I feared: he was not there.  But everybody\nelse was.  Many writers whom I had quite forgotten, or remembered but\nfaintly, lived again for me, they and their work, in Mr. Holbrook\nJackson's pages.  The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly\nwritten.  And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier\nrecord of poor Soames's failure to impress himself on his decade.\n\nI dare say I am the only person who noticed the omission.  Soames had\nfailed so piteously as all that!  Nor is there a counterpoise in the\nthought that if he had had some measure of success he might have\npassed, like those others, out of my mind, to return only at the\nhistorian's beck.  It is true that had his gifts, such as they were,\nbeen acknowledged in his lifetime, he would never have made the bargain\nI saw him make--that strange bargain whose results have kept him always\nin the foreground of my memory.  But it is from those very results that\nthe full piteousness of him glares out.\n\nNot my compassion, however, impels me to write of him.  For his sake,\npoor fellow, I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink.  It is\nill to deride the dead.  And how can I write about Enoch Soames without\nmaking him ridiculous?  Or, rather, how am I to hush up the horrid fact\nthat he WAS ridiculous?  I shall not be able to do that.  Yet, sooner\nor later, write about him I must.  You will see in due course that I\nhave no option.  And I may as well get the thing done now.\n\nIn the summer term of '93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford.\nIt drove deep; it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil.  Dons and\nundergraduates stood around, rather pale, discussing nothing but it.\nWhence came it, this meteorite?  From Paris.  Its name?  Will\nRothenstein. Its aim?  To do a series of twenty-four portraits in\nlithograph.  These were to be published from the Bodley Head, London.\nThe matter was urgent. Already the warden of A, and the master of B,\nand the Regius Professor of C had meekly \"sat.\"  Dignified and\ndoddering old men who had never consented to sit to any one could not\nwithstand this dynamic little stranger.  He did not sue; he invited: he\ndid not invite; he commanded.  He was twenty-one years old.  He wore\nspectacles that flashed more than any other pair ever seen.  He was a\nwit.  He was brimful of ideas.  He knew Whistler.  He knew Daudet and\nthe Goncourts.  He knew every one in Paris.  He knew them all by heart.\nHe was Paris in Oxford.  It was whispered that, so soon as he had\npolished off his selection of dons, he was going to include a few\nundergraduates.  It was a proud day for me when I--I was included.  I\nliked Rothenstein not less than I feared him; and there arose between\nus a friendship that has grown ever warmer, and been more and more\nvalued by me, with every passing year.\n\nAt the end of term he settled in, or, rather, meteoritically into,\nLondon.  It was to him I owed my first knowledge of that\nforever-enchanting little world-in-itself, Chelsea, and my first\nacquaintance with Walter Sickert and other August elders who dwelt\nthere.  It was Rothenstein that took me to see, in Cambridge Street,\nPimlico, a young man whose drawings were already famous among the\nfew--Aubrey Beardsley by name.  With Rothenstein I paid my first visit\nto the Bodley Head.  By him I was inducted into another haunt of\nintellect and daring, the domino-room of the Cafe Royal.\n\nThere, on that October evening--there, in that exuberant vista of\ngilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors and\nupholding caryatids, with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the painted\nand pagan ceiling, and with the hum of presumably cynical conversation\nbroken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of dominoes\nshuffled on marble tables, I drew a deep breath and, \"This indeed,\"\nsaid I to myself, \"is life!\"  (Forgive me that theory.  Remember the\nwaging of even the South African War was not yet.)\n\nIt was the hour before dinner.  We drank vermuth.  Those who knew\nRothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by name.\nMen were constantly coming in through the swing-doors and wandering\nslowly up and down in search of vacant tables or of tables occupied by\nfriends.  One of these rovers interested me because I was sure he\nwanted to catch Rothenstein's eye.  He had twice passed our table, with\na hesitating look; but Rothenstein, in the thick of a disquisition on\nPuvis de Chavannes, had not seen him.  He was a stooping, shambling\nperson, rather tall, very pale, with longish and brownish hair.  He had\na thin, vague beard, or, rather, he had a chin on which a large number\nof hairs weakly curled and clustered to cover its retreat.  He was an\nodd-looking person; but in the nineties odd apparitions were more\nfrequent, I think, than they are now.  The young writers of that\nera--and I was sure this man was a writer--strove earnestly to be\ndistinct in aspect.  This man had striven unsuccessfully.  He wore a\nsoft black hat of clerical kind, but of Bohemian intention, and a gray\nwaterproof cape which, perhaps because it was waterproof, failed to be\nromantic.  I decided that \"dim\" was the mot juste for him.  I had\nalready essayed to write, and was immensely keen on the mot juste, that\nHoly Grail of the period.\n\nThe dim man was now again approaching our table, and this time he made\nup his mind to pause in front of it.\n\n\"You don't remember me,\" he said in a toneless voice.\n\nRothenstein brightly focused him.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" he replied after a moment, with pride rather than\neffusion--pride in a retentive memory.  \"Edwin Soames.\"\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" said Enoch.\n\n\"Enoch Soames,\" repeated Rothenstein in a tone implying that it was\nenough to have hit on the surname.  \"We met in Paris a few times when\nyou were living there.  We met at the Cafe Groche.\"\n\n\"And I came to your studio once.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I was sorry I was out.\"\n\n\"But you were in.  You showed me some of your paintings, you know.  I\nhear you're in Chelsea now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI almost wondered that Mr. Soames did not, after this monosyllable,\npass along.  He stood patiently there, rather like a dumb animal,\nrather like a donkey looking over a gate.  A sad figure, his.  It\noccurred to me that \"hungry\" was perhaps the mot juste for him;\nbut--hungry for what?  He looked as if he had little appetite for\nanything.  I was sorry for him; and Rothenstein, though he had not\ninvited him to Chelsea, did ask him to sit down and have something to\ndrink.\n\nSeated, he was more self-assertive.  He flung back the wings of his\ncape with a gesture which, had not those wings been waterproof, might\nhave seemed to hurl defiance at things in general.  And he ordered an\nabsinthe.  \"Je me tiens toujours fidele,\" he told Rothenstein, \"a la\nsorciere glauque.\"\n\n\"It is bad for you,\" said Rothenstein, dryly.\n\n\"Nothing is bad for one,\" answered Soames.  \"Dans ce monde il n'y a ni\nbien ni mal.\"\n\n\"Nothing good and nothing bad?  How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I explained it all in the preface to 'Negations.'\"\n\n\"'Negations'?\"\n\n\"Yes, I gave you a copy of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course.  But, did you explain, for instance, that there\nwas no such thing as bad or good grammar?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" said Soames.  \"Of course in art there is the good and the evil.\nBut in life--no.\"  He was rolling a cigarette.  He had weak, white\nhands, not well washed, and with finger-tips much stained with\nnicotine.  \"In life there are illusions of good and evil, but\"--his\nvoice trailed away to a murmur in which the words \"vieux jeu\" and\n\"rococo\" were faintly audible.  I think he felt he was not doing\nhimself justice, and feared that Rothenstein was going to point out\nfallacies.  Anyhow, he cleared his throat and said, \"Parlons d'autre\nchose.\"\n\nIt occurs to you that he was a fool?  It didn't to me.  I was young,\nand had not the clarity of judgment that Rothenstein already had.\nSoames was quite five or six years older than either of us.  Also--he\nhad written a book.  It was wonderful to have written a book.\n\nIf Rothenstein had not been there, I should have revered Soames.  Even\nas it was, I respected him.  And I was very near indeed to reverence\nwhen he said he had another book coming out soon.  I asked if I might\nask what kind of book it was to be.\n\n\"My poems,\" he answered.  Rothenstein asked if this was to be the title\nof the book.  The poet meditated on this suggestion, but said he rather\nthought of giving the book no title at all.  \"If a book is good in\nitself--\" he murmured, and waved his cigarette.\n\nRothenstein objected that absence of title might be bad for the sale of\na book.\n\n\"If,\" he urged, \"I went into a bookseller's and said simply, 'Have you\ngot?' or, 'Have you a copy of?' how would they know what I wanted?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I should have my name on the cover,\" Soames answered\nearnestly.  \"And I rather want,\" he added, looking hard at Rothenstein,\n\"to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece.\"  Rothenstein admitted\nthat this was a capital idea, and mentioned that he was going into the\ncountry and would be there for some time.  He then looked at his watch,\nexclaimed at the hour, paid the waiter, and went away with me to\ndinner.  Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch.\n\n\"Why were you so determined not to draw him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Draw him?  Him?  How can one draw a man who doesn't exist?\"\n\n\"He is dim,\" I admitted.  But my mot juste fell flat.  Rothenstein\nrepeated that Soames was non-existent.\n\nStill, Soames had written a book.  I asked if Rothenstein had read\n\"Negations.\"  He said he had looked into it, \"but,\" he added crisply,\n\"I don't profess to know anything about writing.\"  A reservation very\ncharacteristic of the period!  Painters would not then allow that any\none outside their own order had a right to any opinion about painting.\nThis law (graven on the tablets brought down by Whistler from the\nsummit of Fuji-yama) imposed certain limitations.  If other arts than\npainting were not utterly unintelligible to all but the men who\npracticed them, the law tottered--the Monroe Doctrine, as it were, did\nnot hold good.  Therefore no painter would offer an opinion of a book\nwithout warning you at any rate that his opinion was worthless.  No one\nis a better judge of literature than Rothenstein; but it wouldn't have\ndone to tell him so in those days, and I knew that I must form an\nunaided judgment of \"Negations.\"\n\nNot to buy a book of which I had met the author face to face would have\nbeen for me in those days an impossible act of self-denial.  When I\nreturned to Oxford for the Christmas term I had duly secured\n\"Negations.\"  I used to keep it lying carelessly on the table in my\nroom, and whenever a friend took it up and asked what it was about, I\nwould say: \"Oh, it's rather a remarkable book.  It's by a man whom I\nknow.\" Just \"what it was about\" I never was able to say.  Head or tail\nwas just what I hadn't made of that slim, green volume.  I found in the\npreface no clue to the labyrinth of contents, and in that labyrinth\nnothing to explain the preface.\n\n\n  Lean near to life.  Lean very near--\n  nearer.\n\n  Life is web and therein nor warp nor\n  woof is, but web only.\n\n  It is for this I am Catholick in church\n  and in thought, yet do let swift Mood weave\n  there what the shuttle of Mood wills.\n\n\nThese were the opening phrases of the preface, but those which followed\nwere less easy to understand.  Then came \"Stark: A Conte,\" about a\nmidinette who, so far as I could gather, murdered, or was about to\nmurder, a mannequin.  It was rather like a story by Catulle Mendes in\nwhich the translator had either skipped or cut out every alternate\nsentence.  Next, a dialogue between Pan and St. Ursula, lacking, I\nrather thought, in \"snap.\" Next, some aphorisms (entitled \"Aphorismata\"\n[spelled in Greek]).  Throughout, in fact, there was a great variety of\nform, and the forms had evidently been wrought with much care.  It was\nrather the substance that eluded me.  Was there, I wondered, any\nsubstance at all?  It did now occur to me: suppose Enoch Soames was a\nfool!  Up cropped a rival hypothesis: suppose _I_ was!  I inclined to\ngive Soames the benefit of the doubt.  I had read \"L'Apres-midi d'un\nfaune\" without extracting a glimmer of meaning; yet Mallarme, of\ncourse, was a master.  How was I to know that Soames wasn't another?\nThere was a sort of music in his prose, not indeed, arresting, but\nperhaps, I thought, haunting, and laden, perhaps, with meanings as deep\nas Mallarme's own.  I awaited his poems with an open mind.\n\nAnd I looked forward to them with positive impatience after I had had a\nsecond meeting with him.  This was on an evening in January.  Going\ninto the aforesaid domino-room, I had passed a table at which sat a\npale man with an open book before him.  He had looked from his book to\nme, and I looked back over my shoulder with a vague sense that I ought\nto have recognized him.  I returned to pay my respects.  After\nexchanging a few words, I said with a glance to the open book, \"I see I\nam interrupting you,\" and was about to pass on, but, \"I prefer,\" Soames\nreplied in his toneless voice, \"to be interrupted,\" and I obeyed his\ngesture that I should sit down.\n\nI asked him if he often read here.\n\n\"Yes; things of this kind I read here,\" he answered, indicating the\ntitle of his book--\"The Poems of Shelley.\"\n\n\"Anything that you really\"--and I was going to say \"admire?\"  But I\ncautiously left my sentence unfinished, and was glad that I had done\nso, for he said with unwonted emphasis, \"Anything second-rate.\"\n\nI had read little of Shelley, but, \"Of course,\" I murmured, \"he's very\nuneven.\"\n\n\"I should have thought evenness was just what was wrong with him.  A\ndeadly evenness.  That's why I read him here.  The noise of this place\nbreaks the rhythm.  He's tolerable here.\"  Soames took up the book and\nglanced through the pages.  He laughed.  Soames's laugh was a short,\nsingle, and mirthless sound from the throat, unaccompanied by any\nmovement of the face or brightening of the eyes.  \"What a period!\" he\nuttered, laying the book down.  And, \"What a country!\" he added.\n\nI asked rather nervously if he didn't think Keats had more or less held\nhis own against the drawbacks of time and place.  He admitted that\nthere were \"passages in Keats,\" but did not specify them.  Of \"the\nolder men,\" as he called them, he seemed to like only Milton.\n\"Milton,\" he said, \"wasn't sentimental.\"  Also, \"Milton had a dark\ninsight.\"  And again, \"I can always read Milton in the reading-room.\"\n\n\"The reading-room?\"\n\n\"Of the British Museum.  I go there every day.\"\n\n\"You do?  I've only been there once.  I'm afraid I found it rather a\ndepressing place.  It--it seemed to sap one's vitality.\"\n\n\"It does.  That's why I go there.  The lower one's vitality, the more\nsensitive one is to great art.  I live near the museum.  I have rooms\nin Dyott Street.\"\n\n\"And you go round to the reading-room to read Milton?\"\n\n\"Usually Milton.\"  He looked at me.  \"It was Milton,\" he\ncertificatively added, \"who converted me to diabolism.\"\n\n\"Diabolism?  Oh, yes?  Really?\" said I, with that vague discomfort and\nthat intense desire to be polite which one feels when a man speaks of\nhis own religion.  \"You--worship the devil?\"\n\nSoames shook his head.\n\n\"It's not exactly worship,\" he qualified, sipping his absinthe.  \"It's\nmore a matter of trusting and encouraging.\"\n\n\"I see, yes.  I had rather gathered from the preface to 'Negations'\nthat you were a--a Catholic.\"\n\n\"Je l'etais a cette epoque.  In fact, I still am.  I am a Catholic\ndiabolist.\"\n\nBut this profession he made in an almost cursory tone.  I could see\nthat what was upmost in his mind was the fact that I had read\n\"Negations.\"  His pale eyes had for the first time gleamed.  I felt as\none who is about to be examined viva voce on the very subject in which\nhe is shakiest.  I hastily asked him how soon his poems were to be\npublished.\n\n\"Next week,\" he told me.\n\n\"And are they to be published without a title?\"\n\n\"No.  I found a title at last.  But I sha'n't tell you what it is,\" as\nthough I had been so impertinent as to inquire.  \"I am not sure that it\nwholly satisfies me.  But it is the best I can find.  It suggests\nsomething of the quality of the poems--strange growths, natural and\nwild, yet exquisite,\" he added, \"and many-hued, and full of poisons.\"\n\nI asked him what he thought of Baudelaire.  He uttered the snort that\nwas his laugh, and, \"Baudelaire,\" he said, \"was a bourgeois malgre\nlui.\"  France had had only one poet--Villon; \"and two thirds of Villon\nwere sheer journalism.\"  Verlaine was \"an epicier malgre lui.\"\nAltogether, rather to my surprise, he rated French literature lower\nthan English.  There were \"passages\" in Villiers de l'Isle-Adam.  But,\n\"I,\" he summed up, \"owe nothing to France.\"  He nodded at me.  \"You'll\nsee,\" he predicted.\n\nI did not, when the time came, quite see that.  I thought the author of\n\"Fungoids\" did, unconsciously of course, owe something to the young\nParisian decadents or to the young English ones who owed something to\nTHEM.  I still think so.  The little book, bought by me in Oxford, lies\nbefore me as I write.  Its pale-gray buckram cover and silver lettering\nhave not worn well.  Nor have its contents.  Through these, with a\nmelancholy interest, I have again been looking.  They are not much.\nBut at the time of their publication I had a vague suspicion that they\nMIGHT be.  I suppose it is my capacity for faith, not poor Soames's\nwork, that is weaker than it once was.\n\n\n  TO A YOUNG WOMAN\n\n  THOU ART, WHO HAST NOT BEEN!\n\n  Pale tunes irresolute\n\n  And traceries of old sounds\n\n  Blown from a rotted flute\n  Mingle with noise of cymbals rouged with rust,\n  Nor not strange forms and epicene\n\n  Lie bleeding in the dust,\n\n  Being wounded with wounds.\n\n  For this it is\n  That in thy counterpart\n\n  Of age-long mockeries\n  THOU HAST NOT BEEN NOR ART!\n\n\nThere seemed to me a certain inconsistency as between the first and\nlast lines of this.  I tried, with bent brows, to resolve the discord.\nBut I did not take my failure as wholly incompatible with a meaning in\nSoames's mind.  Might it not rather indicate the depth of his meaning?\nAs for the craftsmanship, \"rouged with rust\" seemed to me a fine\nstroke, and \"nor not\" instead of \"and\" had a curious felicity.  I\nwondered who the \"young woman\" was and what she had made of it all.  I\nsadly  suspect that Soames could not have made more of it than she.\nYet even now, if one doesn't try to make any sense at all of the poem,\nand reads it just for the sound, there is a certain grace of cadence.\nSoames was an artist, in so far as he was anything, poor fellow!\n\nIt seemed to me, when first I read \"Fungoids,\" that, oddly enough, the\ndiabolistic side of him was the best.  Diabolism seemed to be a\ncheerful, even a wholesome influence in his life.\n\n\n     NOCTURNE\n\n  Round and round the shutter'd Square\n  I strolled with the Devil's arm in mine.\n  No sound but the scrape of his hoofs was there\n  And the ring of his laughter and mine.\n    We had drunk black wine.\n\n  I scream'd, \"I will race you, Master!\"\n  \"What matter,\" he shriek'd, \"to-night\n  Which of us runs the faster?\n  There is nothing to fear to-night\n    In the foul moon's light!\"\n\n  Then I look'd him in the eyes\n  And I laugh'd full shrill at the lie he told\n  And the gnawing fear he would fain disguise.\n  It was true, what I'd time and again been told:\n    He was old--old.\n\n\nThere was, I felt, quite a swing about that first stanza--a joyous and\nrollicking note of comradeship.  The second was slightly hysterical,\nperhaps.  But I liked the third, it was so bracingly unorthodox, even\naccording to the tenets of Soames's peculiar sect in the faith.  Not\nmuch \"trusting and encouraging\" here!  Soames triumphantly exposing the\ndevil as a liar, and laughing \"full shrill,\" cut a quite heartening\nfigure, I thought, then!  Now, in the light of what befell, none of his\nother poems depresses me so much as \"Nocturne.\"\n\nI looked out for what the metropolitan reviewers would have to say.\nThey seemed to fall into two classes: those who had little to say and\nthose who had nothing.  The second class was the larger, and the words\nof the first were cold; insomuch that\n\n  Strikes a note of modernity. . . .  These tripping numbers.--\"The\n  Preston Telegraph.\"\n\nwas the only lure offered in advertisements by Soames's publisher.  I\nhad hoped that when next I met the poet I could congratulate him on\nhaving made a stir, for I fancied he was not so sure of his intrinsic\ngreatness as he seemed.  I was but able to say, rather coarsely, when\nnext I did see him, that I hoped \"Fungoids\" was \"selling splendidly.\"\nHe looked at me across his glass of absinthe and asked if I had bought\na copy.  His publisher had told him that three had been sold.  I\nlaughed, as at a jest.\n\n\"You don't suppose I CARE, do you?\" he said, with something like a\nsnarl.  I disclaimed the notion.  He added that he was not a tradesman.\nI said mildly that I wasn't, either, and murmured that an artist who\ngave truly new and great things to the world had always to wait long\nfor recognition.  He said he cared not a sou for recognition.  I agreed\nthat the act of creation was its own reward.\n\nHis moroseness might have alienated me if I had regarded myself as a\nnobody.  But ah! hadn't both John Lane and Aubrey Beardsley suggested\nthat I should write an essay for the great new venture that was\nafoot--\"The Yellow Book\"?  And hadn't Henry Harland, as editor,\naccepted my essay?  And wasn't it to be in the very first number?  At\nOxford I was still in statu pupillari.  In London I regarded myself as\nvery much indeed a graduate now--one whom no Soames could ruffle.\nPartly to show off, partly in sheer good-will, I told Soames he ought\nto contribute to \"The Yellow Book.\"  He uttered from the throat a sound\nof scorn for that publication.\n\nNevertheless, I did, a day or two later, tentatively ask Harland if he\nknew anything of the work of a man called Enoch Soames.  Harland paused\nin the midst of his characteristic stride around the room, threw up his\nhands toward the ceiling, and groaned aloud: he had often met \"that\nabsurd creature\" in Paris, and this very morning had received some\npoems in manuscript from him.\n\n\"Has he NO talent?\" I asked.\n\n\"He has an income.  He's all right.\"  Harland was the most joyous of\nmen and most generous of critics, and he hated to talk of anything\nabout which he couldn't be enthusiastic.  So I dropped the subject of\nSoames. The news that Soames had an income did take the edge off\nsolicitude.  I learned afterward that he was the son of an unsuccessful\nand deceased bookseller in Preston, but had inherited an annuity of\nthree hundred pounds from a married aunt, and had no surviving\nrelatives of any kind. Materially, then, he was \"all right.\"  But there\nwas still a spiritual pathos about him, sharpened for me now by the\npossibility that even the praises of \"The Preston Telegraph\" might not\nhave been forthcoming had he not been the son of a Preston man He had a\nsort of weak doggedness which I could not but admire.  Neither he nor\nhis work received the slightest encouragement; but he persisted in\nbehaving as a personage: always he kept his dingy little flag flying.\nWherever congregated the jeunes feroces of the arts, in whatever Soho\nrestaurant they had just discovered, in whatever music-hall they were\nmost frequently, there was Soames in the midst of them, or, rather, on\nthe fringe of them, a dim, but inevitable, figure.  He never sought to\npropitiate his fellow-writers, never bated a jot of his arrogance about\nhis own work or of his contempt for theirs.  To the painters he was\nrespectful, even humble; but for the poets and prosaists of \"The Yellow\nBook\" and later of \"The Savoy\" he had never a word but of scorn.  He\nwasn't resented.  It didn't occur to anybody that he or his Catholic\ndiabolism mattered.  When, in the autumn of '96, he brought out (at his\nown expense, this time) a third book, his last book, nobody said a word\nfor or against it.  I meant, but forgot, to buy it.  I never saw it,\nand am ashamed to say I don't even remember what it was called.  But I\ndid, at the time of its publication, say to Rothenstein that I thought\npoor old Soames was really a rather tragic figure, and that I believed\nhe would literally die for want of recognition.  Rothenstein scoffed.\nHe said I was trying to get credit for a kind heart which I didn't\npossess; and perhaps this was so.  But at the private view of the New\nEnglish Art Club, a few weeks later, I beheld a pastel portrait of\n\"Enoch Soames, Esq.\"  It was very like him, and very like Rothenstein\nto have done it.  Soames was standing near it, in his soft hat and his\nwaterproof cape, all through the afternoon.  Anybody who knew him would\nhave recognized the portrait at a glance, but nobody who didn't know\nhim would have recognized the portrait from its bystander: it \"existed\"\nso much more than he; it was bound to.  Also, it had not that\nexpression of faint happiness which on that day was discernible, yes,\nin Soames's countenance.  Fame had breathed on him.  Twice again in the\ncourse of the month I went to the New English, and on both occasions\nSoames himself was on view there.  Looking back, I regard the close of\nthat exhibition as having been virtually the close of his career.  He\nhad felt the breath of Fame against his cheek--so late, for such a\nlittle while; and at its withdrawal he gave in, gave up, gave out.  He,\nwho had never looked strong or well, looked ghastly now--a shadow of\nthe shade he had once been.  He still frequented the domino-room, but\nhaving lost all wish to excite curiosity, he no longer read books\nthere.  \"You read only at the museum now?\" I asked, with attempted\ncheerfulness.  He said he never went there now.  \"No absinthe there,\"\nhe muttered.  It was the sort of thing that in old days he would have\nsaid for effect; but it carried conviction now.  Absinthe, erst but a\npoint in the \"personality\" he had striven so hard to build up, was\nsolace and necessity now.  He no longer called it \"la sorciere\nglauque.\"   He had shed away all his French phrases.  He had become a\nplain, unvarnished Preston man.\n\nFailure, if it be a plain, unvarnished, complete failure, and even\nthough it be a squalid failure, has always a certain dignity.  I\navoided Soames because he made me feel rather vulgar.  John Lane had\npublished, by this time, two little books of mine, and they had had a\npleasant little success of esteem.  I was a--slight, but\ndefinite--\"personality.\"  Frank Harris had engaged me to kick up my\nheels in \"The Saturday Review,\" Alfred Harmsworth was letting me do\nlikewise in \"The Daily Mail.\"  I was just what Soames wasn't.  And he\nshamed my gloss.  Had I known that he really and firmly believed in the\ngreatness of what he as an artist had achieved, I might not have\nshunned him.  No man who hasn't lost his vanity can be held to have\naltogether failed.  Soames's dignity was an illusion of mine.  One day,\nin the first week of June, 1897, that illusion went.  But on the\nevening of that day Soames went, too.\n\nI had been out most of the morning and, as it was too late to reach\nhome in time for luncheon, I sought the Vingtieme.  This little\nplace--Restaurant du Vingtieme Siecle, to give it its full title--had\nbeen discovered in '96 by the poets and prosaists, but had now been\nmore or less abandoned in favor of some later find.  I don't think it\nlived long enough to justify its name; but at that time there it still\nwas, in Greek Street, a few doors from Soho Square, and almost opposite\nto that house where, in the first years of the century, a little girl,\nand with her a boy named De Quincey, made nightly encampment in\ndarkness and hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments.  The\nVingtieme was but a small whitewashed room, leading out into the street\nat one end and into a kitchen at the other.  The proprietor and cook\nwas a Frenchman, known to us as Monsieur Vingtieme; the waiters were\nhis two daughters, Rose and Berthe; and the food, according to faith,\nwas good.  The tables were so narrow and were set so close together\nthat there was space for twelve of them, six jutting from each wall.\n\nOnly the two nearest to the door, as I went in, were occupied.  On one\nside sat a tall, flashy, rather Mephistophelian man whom I had seen\nfrom time to time in the domino-room and elsewhere.  On the other side\nsat Soames.  They made a queer contrast in that sunlit room, Soames\nsitting haggard in that hat and cape, which nowhere at any season had I\nseen him doff, and this other, this keenly vital man, at sight of whom\nI more than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant, a\nconjurer, or the head of a private detective agency.  I was sure Soames\ndidn't want my company; but I asked, as it would have seemed brutal not\nto, whether I might join him, and took the chair opposite to his.  He\nwas smoking a cigarette, with an untasted salmi of something on his\nplate and a half-empty bottle of Sauterne before him, and he was quite\nsilent.  I said that the preparations for the Jubilee made London\nimpossible.  (I rather liked them, really.) I professed a wish to go\nright away till the whole thing was over.  In vain did I attune myself\nto his gloom.  He seemed not to hear me or even to see me.  I felt that\nhis behavior made me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man.  The\ngangway between the two rows of tables at the Vingtieme was hardly more\nthan two feet wide (Rose and Berthe, in their ministrations, had always\nto edge past each other, quarreling in whispers as they did so), and\nany one at the table abreast of yours was virtually at yours.  I\nthought our neighbor was amused at my failure to interest Soames, and\nso, as I could not explain to him that my insistence was merely\ncharitable, I became silent.  Without turning my head, I had him well\nwithin my range of vision.  I hoped I looked less vulgar than he in\ncontrast with Soames.  I was sure he was not an Englishman, but what\nWAS his nationality?  Though his jet-black hair was en brosse, I did\nnot think he was French.  To Berthe, who waited on him, he spoke French\nfluently, but with a hardly native idiom and accent.  I gathered that\nthis was his first visit to the Vingtieme; but Berthe was offhand in\nher manner to him: he had not made a good impression.  His eyes were\nhandsome, but, like the Vingtieme's tables, too narrow and set too\nclose together.  His nose was predatory, and the points of his\nmustache, waxed up behind his nostrils, gave a fixity to his smile.\nDecidedly, he was sinister.  And my sense of discomfort in his presence\nwas intensified by the scarlet waistcoat which tightly, and so\nunseasonably in June, sheathed his ample chest.  This waistcoat wasn't\nwrong merely because of the heat, either.  It was somehow all wrong in\nitself.  It wouldn't have done on Christmas morning.  It would have\nstruck a jarring note at the first night of \"Hernani.\"  I was trying to\naccount for its wrongness when Soames suddenly and strangely broke\nsilence.  \"A hundred years hence!\" he murmured, as in a trance.\n\n\"We shall not be here,\" I briskly, but fatuously, added.\n\n\"We shall not be here.  No,\" he droned, \"but the museum will still be\njust where it is.  And the reading-room just where it is.  And people\nwill be able to go and read there.\"  He inhaled sharply, and a spasm as\nof actual pain contorted his features.\n\nI wondered what train of thought poor Soames had been following.  He\ndid not enlighten me when he said, after a long pause, \"You think I\nhaven't minded.\"\n\n\"Minded what, Soames?\"\n\n\"Neglect.  Failure.\"\n\n\"FAILURE?\" I said heartily.  \"Failure?\" I repeated vaguely.\n\"Neglect--yes, perhaps; but that's quite another matter.  Of course you\nhaven't been--appreciated.  But what, then?  Any artist who--who\ngives--\"  What I wanted to say was, \"Any artist who gives truly new and\ngreat things to the world has always to wait long for recognition\"; but\nthe flattery would not out: in the face of his misery--a misery so\ngenuine and so unmasked--my lips would not say the words.\n\nAnd then he said them for me.  I flushed.  \"That's what you were going\nto say, isn't it?\" he asked.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"It's what you said to me three years ago, when 'Fungoids' was\npublished.\"  I flushed the more.  I need not have flushed at all.\n\"It's the only important thing I ever heard you say,\" he continued.\n\"And I've never forgotten it.  It's a true thing.  It's a horrible\ntruth.  But--d'you remember what I answered?  I said, 'I don't care a\nsou for recognition.' And you believed me.  You've gone on believing\nI'm above that sort of thing.  You're shallow.  What should YOU know of\nthe feelings of a man like me?  You imagine that a great artist's faith\nin himself and in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy.\nYou've never guessed at the bitterness and loneliness, the\"--his voice\nbroke; but presently he resumed, speaking with a force that I had never\nknown in him.  \"Posterity!  What use is it to ME?  A dead man doesn't\nknow that people are visiting his grave, visiting his birthplace,\nputting up tablets to him, unveiling statues of him.  A dead man can't\nread the books that are written about him.  A hundred years hence!\nThink of it!  If I could come back to life THEN--just for a few\nhours--and go to the reading-room and READ!  Or, better still, if I\ncould be projected now, at this moment, into that future, into that\nreading-room, just for this one afternoon!  I'd sell myself body and\nsoul to the devil for that!  Think of the pages and pages in the\ncatalogue: 'Soames, Enoch' endlessly--endless editions, commentaries,\nprolegomena, biographies\"--  But here he was interrupted by a sudden\nloud crack of the chair at the next table.  Our neighbor had half risen\nfrom his place.  He was leaning toward us, apologetically intrusive.\n\n\"Excuse--permit me,\" he said softly.  \"I have been unable not to hear.\nMight I take a liberty?  In this little restaurant-sans-facon--might I,\nas the phrase is, cut in?\"\n\nI could but signify our acquiescence.  Berthe had appeared at the\nkitchen door, thinking the stranger wanted his bill.  He waved her away\nwith his cigar, and in another moment had seated himself beside me,\ncommanding a full view of Soames.\n\n\"Though not an Englishman,\" he explained, \"I know my London well, Mr.\nSoames.  Your name and fame--Mr. Beerbohm's, too--very known to me.\nYour point is, who am _I_?\"  He glanced quickly over his shoulder, and\nin a lowered voice said, \"I am the devil.\"\n\nI couldn't help it; I laughed.  I tried not to, I knew there was\nnothing to laugh at, my rudeness shamed me; but--I laughed with\nincreasing volume.  The devil's quiet dignity, the surprise and disgust\nof his raised eyebrows, did but the more dissolve me.  I rocked to and\nfro; I lay back aching; I behaved deplorably.\n\n\"I am a gentleman, and,\" he said with intense emphasis, \"I thought I\nwas in the company of GENTLEMEN.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" I gasped faintly.  \"Oh, don't!\"\n\n\"Curious, nicht wahr?\" I heard him say to Soames.  \"There is a type of\nperson to whom the very mention of my name is--oh, so awfully--funny!\nIn your theaters the dullest comedien needs only to say 'The devil!'\nand right away they give him 'the loud laugh what speaks the vacant\nmind.'  Is it not so?\"\n\nI had now just breath enough to offer my apologies.  He accepted them,\nbut coldly, and re-addressed himself to Soames.\n\n\"I am a man of business,\" he said, \"and always I would put things\nthrough 'right now,' as they say in the States.  You are a poet.  Les\naffaires--you detest them.  So be it.  But with me you will deal, eh?\nWhat you have said just now gives me furiously to hope.\"\n\nSoames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette.  He sat\ncrouched forward, with his elbows squared on the table, and his head\njust above the level of his hands, staring up at the devil.\n\n\"Go on,\" he nodded.  I had no remnant of laughter in me now.\n\n\"It will be the more pleasant, our little deal,\" the devil went on,\n\"because you are--I mistake not?--a diabolist.\"\n\n\"A Catholic diabolist,\" said Soames.\n\nThe devil accepted the reservation genially.\n\n\"You wish,\" he resumed, \"to visit now--this afternoon as-ever-is--the\nreading-room of the British Museum, yes?  But of a hundred years hence,\nyes?  Parfaitement.  Time--an illusion.  Past and future--they are as\never present as the present, or at any rate only what you call 'just\nround the corner.'  I switch you on to any date.  I project you--pouf!\nYou wish to be in the reading-room just as it will be on the afternoon\nof June 3, 1997?  You wish to find yourself standing in that room, just\npast the swing-doors, this very minute, yes?  And to stay there till\nclosing-time?  Am I right?\"\n\nSoames nodded.\n\nThe devil looked at his watch.  \"Ten past two,\" he said.  \"Closing-time\nin summer same then as now--seven o'clock.  That will give you almost\nfive hours.  At seven o'clock--pouf!--you find yourself again here,\nsitting at this table.  I am dining to-night dans le monde--dans le\nhiglif.  That concludes my present visit to your great city.  I come\nand fetch you here, Mr. Soames, on my way home.\"\n\n\"Home?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Be it never so humble!\" said the devil, lightly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Soames.\n\n\"Soames!\" I entreated.  But my friend moved not a muscle.\n\nThe devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the\ntable, but he paused in his gesture.\n\n\"A hundred years hence, as now,\" he smiled, \"no smoking allowed in the\nreading-room.  You would better therefore--\"\n\nSoames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his\nglass of Sauterne.\n\n\"Soames!\" again I cried.  \"Can't you\"--but the devil had now stretched\nforth his hand across the table.  He brought it slowly down on the\ntable-cloth.  Soames's chair was empty.  His cigarette floated sodden\nin his wine-glass.  There was no other trace of him.\n\nFor a few moments the devil let his hand rest where it lay, gazing at\nme out of the corners of his eyes, vulgarly triumphant.\n\nA shudder shook me.  With an effort I controlled myself and rose from\nmy chair.  \"Very clever,\" I said condescendingly.  \"But--'The Time\nMachine' is a delightful book, don't you think?  So entirely original!\"\n\n\"You are pleased to sneer,\" said the devil, who had also risen, \"but it\nis one thing to write about an impossible machine; it is a quite other\nthing to be a supernatural power.\"  All the same, I had scored.\n\nBerthe had come forth at the sound of our rising.  I explained to her\nthat Mr. Soames had been called away, and that both he and I would be\ndining here.  It was not until I was out in the open air that I began\nto feel giddy.  I have but the haziest recollection of what I did,\nwhere I wandered, in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon.  I\nremember the sound of carpenters' hammers all along Piccadilly and the\nbare chaotic look of the half-erected \"stands.\"  Was it in the Green\nPark or in Kensington Gardens or WHERE was it that I sat on a chair\nbeneath a tree, trying to read an evening paper?  There was a phrase in\nthe leading article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mind:\n\"Little is hidden from this August Lady full of the garnered wisdom of\nsixty years of Sovereignty.\"  I remember wildly conceiving a letter (to\nreach Windsor by an express messenger told to await answer): \"Madam:\nWell knowing that your Majesty is full of the garnered wisdom of sixty\nyears of Sovereignty, I venture to ask your advice in the following\ndelicate matter.  Mr. Enoch Soames, whose poems you may or may not\nknow--\" Was there NO way of helping him, saving him?  A bargain was a\nbargain, and I was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out\nof a reasonable obligation.  I wouldn't have lifted a little finger to\nsave Faust. But poor Soames!  Doomed to pay without respite an eternal\nprice for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning.\n\nOdd and uncanny it seemed to me that he, Soames, in the flesh, in the\nwaterproof cape, was at this moment living in the last decade of the\nnext century, poring over books not yet written, and seeing and seen by\nmen not yet born.  Uncannier and odder still that to-night and evermore\nhe would be in hell.  Assuredly, truth was stranger than fiction.\n\nEndless that afternoon was.  Almost I wished I had gone with Soames,\nnot, indeed, to stay in the reading-room, but to sally forth for a\nbrisk sight-seeing walk around a new London.  I wandered restlessly out\nof the park I had sat in.  Vainly I tried to imagine myself an ardent\ntourist from the eighteenth century.  Intolerable was the strain of the\nslow-passing and empty minutes.  Long before seven o'clock I was back\nat the Vingtieme.\n\nI sat there just where I had sat for luncheon.  Air came in listlessly\nthrough the open door behind me.  Now and again Rose or Berthe appeared\nfor a moment.  I had told them I would not order any dinner till Mr.\nSoames came.  A hurdy-gurdy began to play, abruptly drowning the noise\nof a quarrel between some Frenchmen farther up the street.  Whenever\nthe tune was changed I heard the quarrel still raging.  I had bought\nanother evening paper on my way.  I unfolded it.  My eyes gazed ever\naway from it to the clock over the kitchen door.\n\nFive minutes now to the hour!  I remembered that clocks in restaurants\nare kept five minutes fast.  I concentrated my eyes on the paper.  I\nvowed I would not look away from it again.  I held it upright, at its\nfull width, close to my face, so that I had no view of anything but it.\nRather a tremulous sheet?  Only because of the draft, I told myself.\n\nMy arms gradually became stiff; they ached; but I could not drop\nthem--now.  I had a suspicion, I had a certainty.  Well, what, then?\nWhat else had I come for?  Yet I held tight that barrier of newspaper.\nOnly the sound of Berthe's brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me,\nforced me, to drop it, and to utter:\n\n\"What shall we have to eat, Soames?\"\n\n\"Il est souffrant, ce pauvre Monsieur Soames?\" asked Berthe.\n\n\"He's only--tired.\"  I asked her to get some wine--Burgundy--and\nwhatever food might be ready.  Soames sat crouched forward against the\ntable exactly as when last I had seen him.  It was as though he had\nnever moved--he who had moved so unimaginably far.  Once or twice in\nthe afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his\njourney was not to be fruitless, that perhaps we had all been wrong in\nour estimate of the works of Enoch Soames.  That we had been horribly\nright was horribly clear from the look of him.  But, \"Don't be\ndiscouraged,\" I falteringly said.  \"Perhaps it's only that you--didn't\nleave enough time.  Two, three centuries hence, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" his voice came; \"I've thought of that.\"\n\n\"And now--now for the more immediate future!  Where are you going to\nhide?  How would it be if you caught the Paris express from Charing\nCross?  Almost an hour to spare.  Don't go on to Paris.  Stop at\nCalais.  Live in Calais.  He'd never think of looking for you in\nCalais.\"\n\n\"It's like my luck,\" he said, \"to spend my last hours on earth with an\nass.\"  But I was not offended.  \"And a treacherous ass,\" he strangely\nadded, tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been\nholding in his hand.  I glanced at the writing on it--some sort of\ngibberish, apparently.  I laid it impatiently aside.\n\n\"Come, Soames, pull yourself together!  This isn't a mere matter of\nlife or death.  It's a question of eternal torment, mind you!  You\ndon't mean to say you're going to wait limply here till the devil comes\nto fetch you.\"\n\n\"I can't do anything else.  I've no choice.\"\n\n\"Come!  This is 'trusting and encouraging' with a vengeance!  This is\ndiabolism run mad!\"  I filled his glass with wine.  \"Surely, now that\nyou've SEEN the brute--\"\n\n\"It's no good abusing him.\"\n\n\"You must admit there's nothing Miltonic about him, Soames.\"\n\n\"I don't say he's not rather different from what I expected.\"\n\n\"He's a vulgarian, he's a swell mobs-man, he's the sort of man who\nhangs about the corridors of trains going to the Riviera and steals\nladies' jewel-cases.  Imagine eternal torment presided over by HIM!\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I look forward to it, do you?\"\n\n\"Then why not slip quietly out of the way?\"\n\nAgain and again I filled his glass, and always, mechanically, he\nemptied it; but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him.  He did\nnot eat, and I myself ate hardly at all.  I did not in my heart believe\nthat any dash for freedom could save him.  The chase would be swift,\nthe capture certain.  But better anything than this passive, meek,\nmiserable waiting.  I told Soames that for the honor of the human race\nhe ought to make some show of resistance.  He asked what the human race\nhad ever done for him.  \"Besides,\" he said, \"can't you understand that\nI'm in his power? You saw him touch me, didn't you?  There's an end of\nit.  I've no will.  I'm sealed.\"\n\nI made a gesture of despair.  He went on repeating the word \"sealed.\"\nI began to realize that the wine had clouded his brain.  No wonder!\nFoodless he had gone into futurity, foodless he still was.  I urged him\nto eat, at any rate, some bread.  It was maddening to think that he,\nwho had so much to tell, might tell nothing.  \"How was it all,\" I\nasked, \"yonder?  Come, tell me your adventures!\"\n\n\"They'd make first-rate 'copy,' wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry for you, Soames, and I make all possible allowances;\nbut what earthly right have you to insinuate that I should make 'copy,'\nas you call it, out of you?\"\n\nThe poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.  \"I had some reason, I know.  I'll try to\nremember.  He sat plunged in thought.\n\n\"That's right.  Try to remember everything.  Eat a little more bread.\nWhat did the reading-room look like?\"\n\n\"Much as usual,\" he at length muttered.\n\n\"Many people there?\"\n\n\"Usual sort of number.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\"\n\nSoames tried to visualize them.\n\n\"They all,\" he presently remembered, \"looked very like one another.\"\n\nMy mind took a fearsome leap.\n\n\"All dressed in sanitary woolen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.  Grayish-yellowish stuff.\"\n\n\"A sort of uniform?\"  He nodded.  \"With a number on it perhaps--a\nnumber on a large disk of metal strapped round the left arm?  D. K. F.\n78,910--that sort of thing?\"  It was even so.  \"And all of them, men\nand women alike, looking very well cared for?  Very Utopian, and\nsmelling rather strongly of carbolic, and all of them quite hairless?\"\nI was right every time.  Soames was only not sure whether the men and\nwomen were hairless or shorn.  \"I hadn't time to look at them very\nclosely,\" he explained.\n\n\"No, of course not.  But--\"\n\n\"They stared at ME, I can tell you.  I attracted a great deal of\nattention.\"  At last he had done that!  \"I think I rather scared them.\nThey moved away whenever I came near.  They followed me about, at a\ndistance, wherever I went.  The men at the round desk in the middle\nseemed to have a sort of panic whenever I went to make inquiries.\"\n\n\"What did you do when you arrived?\"\n\nWell, he had gone straight to the catalogue, of course,--to the S\nvolumes,--and had stood long before SN-SOF, unable to take this volume\nout of the shelf because his heart was beating so.  At first, he said,\nhe wasn't disappointed; he only thought there was some new arrangement.\nHe went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of\ntwentieth-century books was kept.  He gathered that there was still\nonly one catalogue.  Again he looked up his name, stared at the three\nlittle pasted slips he had known so well.  Then he went and sat down\nfor a long time.\n\n\"And then,\" he droned, \"I looked up the 'Dictionary of National\nBiography,' and some encyclopedias.  I went back to the middle desk and\nasked what was the best modern book on late nineteenth-century\nliterature.  They told me Mr. T. K. Nupton's book was considered the\nbest.  I looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it.  It\nwas brought to me.  My name wasn't in the index, but--yes!\" he said\nwith a sudden change of tone, \"that's what I'd forgotten.  Where's that\nbit of paper?  Give it me back.\"\n\nI, too, had forgotten that cryptic screed.  I found it fallen on the\nfloor, and handed it to him.\n\nHe smoothed it out, nodding and smiling at me disagreeably.\n\n\"I found myself glancing through Nupton's book,\" he resumed.  \"Not very\neasy reading.  Some sort of phonetic spelling.  All the modern books I\nsaw were phonetic.\"\n\n\"Then I don't want to hear any more, Soames, please.\"\n\n\"The proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way.  But for that\nI mightn't have noticed my own name.\"\n\n\"Your own name?  Really?  Soames, I'm VERY glad.\"\n\n\"And yours.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I thought I should find you waiting here to-night, so I took the\ntrouble to copy out the passage.  Read it.\"\n\nI snatched the paper.  Soames's handwriting was characteristically dim.\nIt and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower to\ngrasp what T. K. Nupton was driving at.\n\nThe document lies before me at this moment.  Strange that the words I\nhere copy out for you were copied out for me by poor Soames just\neighty-two years hence!\n\nFrom page 234 of \"Inglish Littracher 1890-1900\" bi T. K. Nupton,\npublishd bi th Stait, 1992.\n\nFr egzarmpl, a riter ov th time, naimed Max Beerbohm, hoo woz stil\nalive in th twentith senchri, rote a stauri in wich e pautraid an\nimmajnari karrakter kauld \"Enoch Soames\"--a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz\nimself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no\nwot posterriti thinx ov im!

Thank hevvn we hav no Enoch\nSoameses amung us to-dai!\n\n\nI found that by murmuring the words aloud (a device which I commend to\nmy reader) I was able to master them little by little.  The clearer\nthey became, the greater was my bewilderment, my distress and horror.\nThe whole thing was a nightmare.  Afar, the great grisly background of\nwhat was in store for the poor dear art of letters; here, at the table,\nfixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over, the poor fellow\nwhom--whom evidently--but no: whatever down-grade my character might\ntake in coming years, I should never be such a brute as to--\n\nAgain I examined the screed.  \"Immajnari.\"  But here Soames was, no\nmore imaginary, alas! than I.  And \"labud\"--what on earth was that?\n(To this day I have never made out that word.) \"It's all\nvery--baffling,\" I at length stammered.\n\nSoames said nothing, but cruelly did not cease to look at me.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" I temporized, \"quite sure you copied the thing out\ncorrectly?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's this wretched Nupton who must have made--must be\ngoing to make--some idiotic mistake.  Look here Soames, you know me\nbetter than to suppose that I--  After all, the name Max Beerbohm is\nnot at all an uncommon one, and there must be several Enoch Soameses\nrunning around, or, rather, Enoch Soames is a name that might occur to\nany one writing a story.  And I don't write stories; I'm an essayist,\nan observer, a recorder.  I admit that it's an extraordinary\ncoincidence.  But you must see--\"\n\n\"I see the whole thing,\" said Soames, quietly.  And he added, with a\ntouch of his old manner, but with more dignity than I had ever known in\nhim, \"Parlons d'autre chose.\"\n\nI accepted that suggestion very promptly.  I returned straight to the\nmore immediate future.  I spent most of the long evening in renewed\nappeals to Soames to come away and seek refuge somewhere.  I remember\nsaying at last that if indeed I was destined to write about him, the\nsupposed \"stauri\" had better have at least a happy ending.  Soames\nrepeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn.\n\n\"In life and in art,\" he said, \"all that matters is an INEVITABLE\nending.\"\n\n\"But,\" I urged more hopefully than I felt, \"an ending that can be\navoided ISN'T inevitable.\"\n\n\"You aren't an artist,\" he rasped.  \"And you're so hopelessly not an\nartist that, so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem\ntrue, you're going to make even a true thing seem as if you'd made it\nup.  You're a miserable bungler.  And it's like my luck.\"\n\nI protested that the miserable bungler was not I, was not going to be\nI, but T. K. Nupton; and we had a rather heated argument, in the thick\nof which it suddenly seemed to me that Soames saw he was in the wrong:\nhe had quite physically cowered.  But I wondered why--and now I guessed\nwith a cold throb just why--he stared so past me.  The bringer of that\n\"inevitable ending\" filled the doorway.\n\nI managed to turn in my chair and to say, not without a semblance of\nlightness, \"Aha, come in!\"  Dread was indeed rather blunted in me by\nhis looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama.  The sheen of\nhis tilted hat and of his shirt-front, the repeated twists he was\ngiving to his mustache, and most of all the magnificence of his sneer,\ngave token that he was there only to be foiled.\n\nHe was at our table in a stride.  \"I am sorry,\" he sneered witheringly,\n\"to break up your pleasant party, but--\"\n\n\"You don't; you complete it,\" I assured him.  \"Mr. Soames and I want to\nhave a little talk with you.  Won't you sit?  Mr. Soames got nothing,\nfrankly nothing, by his journey this afternoon.  We don't wish to say\nthat the whole thing was a swindle, a common swindle.  On the contrary,\nwe believe you meant well.  But of course the bargain, such as it was,\nis off.\"\n\nThe devil gave no verbal answer.  He merely looked at Soames and\npointed with rigid forefinger to the door.  Soames was wretchedly\nrising from his chair when, with a desperate, quick gesture, I swept\ntogether two dinner-knives that were on the table, and laid their\nblades across each other.  The devil stepped sharp back against the\ntable behind him, averting his face and shuddering.\n\n\"You are not superstitious!\" he hissed.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I smiled.\n\n\"Soames,\" he said as to an underling, but without turning his face,\n\"put those knives straight!\"\n\nWith an inhibitive gesture to my friend, \"Mr. Soames,\" I said\nemphatically to the devil, \"is a Catholic diabolist\"; but my poor\nfriend did the devil's bidding, not mine; and now, with his master's\neyes again fixed on him, he arose, he shuffled past me.  I tried to\nspeak.  It was he that spoke.  \"Try,\" was the prayer he threw back at\nme as the devil pushed him roughly out through the door--\"TRY to make\nthem know that I did exist!\"\n\nIn another instant I, too, was through that door.  I stood staring all\nways, up the street, across it, down it.  There was moonlight and\nlamplight, but there was not Soames nor that other.\n\nDazed, I stood there.  Dazed, I turned back at length into the little\nroom, and I suppose I paid Berthe or Rose for my dinner and luncheon\nand for Soames's; I hope so, for I never went to the Vingtieme again.\nEver since that night I have avoided Greek Street altogether.  And for\nyears I did not set foot even in Soho Square, because on that same\nnight it was there that I paced and loitered, long and long, with some\nsuch dull sense of hope as a man has in not straying far from the place\nwhere he has lost something.  \"Round and round the shutter'd\nSquare\"--that line came back to me on my lonely beat, and with it the\nwhole stanza, ringing in my brain and bearing in on me how tragically\ndifferent from the happy scene imagined by him was the poet's actual\nexperience of that prince in whom of all princes we should put not our\ntrust!\n\nBut strange how the mind of an essayist, be it never so stricken, roves\nand ranges!  I remember pausing before a wide door-step and wondering\nif perchance it was on this very one that the young De Quincey lay ill\nand faint while poor Ann flew as fast as her feet would carry her to\nOxford Street, the \"stony-hearted stepmother\" of them both, and came\nback bearing that \"glass of port wine and spices\" but for which he\nmight, so he thought, actually have died.  Was this the very door-step\nthat the old De Quincey used to revisit in homage?  I pondered Ann's\nfate, the cause of her sudden vanishing from the ken of her boy friend;\nand presently I blamed myself for letting the past override the\npresent.  Poor vanished Soames!\n\nAnd for myself, too, I began to be troubled.  What had I better do?\nWould there be a hue and cry--\"Mysterious Disappearance of an Author,\"\nand all that?  He had last been seen lunching and dining in my company.\nHadn't I better get a hansom and drive straight to Scotland Yard?  They\nwould think I was a lunatic.  After all, I reassured myself, London was\na very large place, and one very dim figure might easily drop out of it\nunobserved, now especially, in the blinding glare of the near Jubilee.\nBetter say nothing at all, I thought.\n\nAND I was right.  Soames's disappearance made no stir at all.  He was\nutterly forgotten before any one, so far as I am aware, noticed that he\nwas no longer hanging around.  Now and again some poet or prosaist may\nhave said to another, \"What has become of that man Soames?\" but I never\nheard any such question asked.  As for his landlady in Dyott Street, no\ndoubt he had paid her weekly, and what possessions he may have had in\nhis rooms were enough to save her from fretting.  The solicitor through\nwhom he was paid his annuity may be presumed to have made inquiries,\nbut no echo of these resounded.  There was something rather ghastly to\nme in the general unconsciousness that Soames had existed, and more\nthan once I caught myself wondering whether Nupton, that babe unborn,\nwere going to be right in thinking him a figment of my brain.\n\nIn that extract from Nupton's repulsive book there is one point which\nperhaps puzzles you.  How is it that the author, though I have here\nmentioned him by name and have quoted the exact words he is going to\nwrite, is not going to grasp the obvious corollary that I have invented\nnothing?  The answer can be only this: Nupton will not have read the\nlater passages of this memoir.  Such lack of thoroughness is a serious\nfault in any one who undertakes to do scholar's work.  And I hope these\nwords will meet the eye of some contemporary rival to Nupton and be the\nundoing of Nupton.\n\nI like to think that some time between 1992 and 1997 somebody will have\nlooked up this memoir, and will have forced on the world his inevitable\nand startling conclusions.  And I have reason for believing that this\nwill be so.  You realize that the reading-room into which Soames was\nprojected by the devil was in all respects precisely as it will be on\nthe afternoon of June 3, 1997.  You realize, therefore, that on that\nafternoon, when it comes round, there the selfsame crowd will be, and\nthere Soames will be, punctually, he and they doing precisely what they\ndid before.  Recall now Soames's account of the sensation he made.  You\nmay say that the mere difference of his costume was enough to make him\nsensational in that uniformed crowd.  You wouldn't say so if you had\never seen him, and I assure you that in no period would Soames be\nanything but dim.  The fact that people are going to stare at him and\nfollow him around and seem afraid of him, can be explained only on the\nhypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly\nvisitation. They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he\nreally would come.  And when he does come the effect will of course\nbe--awful.\n\nAn authentic, guaranteed, proved ghost, but; only a ghost, alas!  Only\nthat.  In his first visit Soames was a creature of flesh and blood,\nwhereas the creatures among whom he was projected were but ghosts, I\ntake it--solid, palpable, vocal, but unconscious and automatic ghosts,\nin a building that was itself an illusion.  Next time that building and\nthose creatures will be real.  It is of Soames that there will be but\nthe semblance.  I wish I could think him destined to revisit the world\nactually, physically, consciously.  I wish he had this one brief\nescape, this one small treat, to look forward to.  I never forget him\nfor long.  He is where he is and forever.  The more rigid moralists\namong you may say he has only himself to blame.  For my part, I think\nhe has been very hardly used. It is well that vanity should be\nchastened; and Enoch Soames's vanity was, I admit, above the average,\nand called for special treatment.  But there was no need for\nvindictiveness.  You say he contracted to pay the price he is paying.\nYes; but I maintain that he was induced to do so by fraud.  Well\ninformed in all things, the devil must have known that my friend would\ngain nothing by his visit to futurity.  The whole thing was a very\nshabby trick.  The more I think of it, the more detestable the devil\nseems to me.\n\nOf him I have caught sight several times, here and there, since that\nday at the Vingtieme.  Only once, however, have I seen him at close\nquarters.  This was a couple of years ago, in Paris.  I was walking one\nafternoon along the rue d'Antin, and I saw him advancing from the\nopposite direction, overdressed as ever, and swinging an ebony cane and\naltogether behaving as though the whole pavement belonged to him.  At\nthought of Enoch Soames and the myriads of other sufferers eternally in\nthis brute's dominion, a great cold wrath filled me, and I drew myself\nup to my full height.  But--well, one is so used to nodding and smiling\nin the street to anybody whom one knows that the action becomes almost\nindependent of oneself; to prevent it requires a very sharp effort and\ngreat presence of mind.  I was miserably aware, as I passed the devil,\nthat I nodded and smiled to him.  And my shame was the deeper and\nhotter because he, if you please, stared straight at me with the utmost\nhaughtiness.\n\nTo be cut, deliberately cut, by HIM!  I was, I still am, furious at\nhaving had that happen to me.\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: I have closed contractions in the text; e.g.,\n\"does n't\" has become \"doesn't\" etc.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Enoch Soames, by Max Beerbohm\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ENOCH SOAMES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 760.txt or 760.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/7/6/760/\n\nProduced by Judith Boss.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nQuestion:\nWhere do Soames and Beerbohm meet for lunch?\n\nAnswer:\n",

Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.

To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.

The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of this Project Gutenberg Etext of Crito, by Plato\n\nQuestion:\nWho persuades Socrates to escape?\n\nAnswer:\n",

People buying groceries, kids playing in\nthe street, etc. General noise of conversation, laughter and children\nshouting. But when the curtain rises there is momentary lull for\ncane-chewing. At left of porch four men are playing cards on a soap\nbox, and seated on the edge of the porch at extreme right two children\nare engaged in a checker game, with the board on the floor between\nthem.\n\nWhen the curtain goes up the following characters are discovered on\nthe porch: MAYOR JOE CLARK, the storekeeper; DEACON HAMBO; DEACON\nGOODWIN; Old Man MATT BRAZZLE; WILL CODY; SYKES JONES; LUM BOGER, the\nyoung town marshall; LIGE MOSELY and WALTER THOMAS, two village wags;\nTOM NIXON and SAM MOSELY, and several others, seated on boxes, kegs,\nbenches and floor of the porch. TONY TAYLOR is sitting on steps of\nporch with empty basket. MRS. TAYLOR comes out with her arms full of\ngroceries, empties them into basket and goes back in store. All the\nmen are chewing sugar cane earnestly with varying facial expressions.\nThe noise of the breaking and sucking of cane can be clearly heard in\nthe silence. Occasionally the laughter and shouting of children is\nheard nearby off stage.\n\nHAMBO: (To BRAZZLE) Say, Matt, gimme a jint or two of dat green\ncane--dis ribbon cane is hard.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, and you ain't got de chears in yo' parlor you useter have.\n\nHAMBO: Dat's all right, Lige, but I betcha right now wid dese few\nteeth I got I kin eat up more cane'n you kin grow.\n\nLIGE: I know you kin and that's de reason I ain't going to tempt you.\nBut youse gettin' old in lots of ways--look at dat bald-head--just as\nclean as my hand. (Exposes his palm).\n\nHAMBO: Don't keer if it tis--I don't want nothin'--not even\nhair--between me and God. (General laughter--LIGE joins in as well.\nCane chewing keeps up. Silence for a moment.)\n\n(Off stage a high shrill voice can be heard calling:)\n\nVOICE: Sister Mosely, Oh, Sister Mosely! (A pause) Miz Mosely! (Very\nirritated) Oh, Sister Mattie! You hear me out here--you just won't\nanswer!\n\nVOICE OF MRS. MOSELY: Whoo-ee ... somebody calling me?\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Angrily) Never mind now--you couldn't come\nwhen I called you. I don't want yo' lil ole weasley turnip greens.\n(Silence)\n\nMATT BRAZZLE: Sister Roberts is en town agin! If she was mine, I'll\nbe hen-fired if I wouldn't break her down in de lines (loins)--good as\ndat man is to her!\n\nHAMBO: I wish she was mine jes' one day--de first time she open her\nmouf to beg _anybody_, I'd lam her wid lightning.\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Jake Roberts buys mo' rations out dis store than any\nman in dis town. I don't see to my Maker whut she do wid it all....\nHere she come....\n\n(ENTER MRS. JAKE ROBERTS, a heavy light brown woman with a basket on\nher arm. A boy about ten walks beside her carrying a small child about\na year old straddle of his back. Her skirts are sweeping the ground.\nShe walks up to the step, puts one foot upon the steps and looks\nforlornly at all the men, then fixes her look on JOE CLARK.)\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: Evenin', Brother Mayor.\n\nCLARK: Howdy do, Mrs. Roberts. How's yo' husband?\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Beginning her professional whine): He ain't much and I\nain't much and my chillun is poly. We ain't got 'nough to eat! Lawd,\nMr. Clark, gimme a lil piece of side meat to cook us a pot of greens.\n\nCLARK: Aw gwan, Sister Roberts. You got plenty bacon home. Last week\nJake bought....\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (Frantically) Lawd, Mist' Clark, how long you think dat\nlil piece of meat last me an' my chillun? Lawd, me and my chillun is\n_hongry_! God knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n\n(MR. CLARK sits unmoved. MRS. ROBERTS advances upon him)\n\nMist' Clark!\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, don't keep on after me! Every time I look, youse\nround here beggin' for everything you see.\n\nLIGE: And whut she don't see she whoops for it just de same.\n\nMRS. ROBERTS: (In dramatic begging pose) Mist' Clark! Ain't you boin'\ndo nuthin' for me? And you see me and my poor chillun is starvin'....\n\nCLARK: (Exasperated rises) I God, woman, a man can't git no peace wid\nsomebody like you in town. (He goes angrily into the store followed by\nMRS. ROBERTS. The boy sits down on the edge of the porch sucking the\nbaby's thumb.)\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: A piece 'bout dis wide....\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: I God, naw! Yo' husband done bought you plenty meat,\nnohow.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (In great anguish) Ow! Mist' Clark! Don't you\ncut dat lil tee-ninchy piece of meat for me and my chillun! (Sound of\nrunning feet inside the store.) I ain't a going to tetch it!\n\nVOICE OF CLARK: Well, don't touch it then. That's all you'll git outa\nme.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Calmer) Well, hand it chear den. Lawd, me and\nmy chillun is _so_ hongry.... Jake don't fee-eed me. (She re-enters by\ndoor of store with the slab of meat in her hand and an outraged look\non her face. She gazes all about her for sympathy.) Lawd, me and my\npoor chillun is _so_ hongry ... and some folks has _every_thing and\nthey's so _stingy_ and gripin'.... Lawd knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!\n(She exits right on this line followed by the boy with the baby on his\nback.)\n\n(All the men gaze behind her, then at each other and shake their\nheads.)\n\nHAMBO: Poor Jak.... I'm really sorry for dat man. If she was mine I'd\nbeat her till her ears hung down like a Georgy mule.\n\nWALTER THOMAS: I'd beat her till she smell like onions.\n\nLIGE: I'd romp on her till she slack like lime.\n\nNIXON: I'd stomp her till she rope like okra.\n\nVOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Off stage right) Lawd, Miz Lewis, you goin'\ngive me dat lil han'ful of greens for me and my chillun. Why dat ain't\na eye-full. I ought not to take 'em ... but me and my chillun is _so_\nhongry.... Some folks is so stingy and gripin'! Lawd knows, Tony don't\n_feed_ me!\n\n(The noise of cane-chewing is heard again. Enter JOE LINDSAY left with\na gun over his shoulder and the large leg bone of a mule in the other\nhand. He approaches the step wearily.)\n\nHAMBO: Well, did you git any partridges, Joe?\n\nJOE: (Resting his gun and seating himself) Nope, but I made de\nfeathers fly.\n\nHAMBO: I don't see no birds.\n\nJOE: Oh, the feathers flew off on de birds.\n\nLIGE: I don't see nothin' but dat bone. Look lak you done kilt a cow\nand et 'im raw out in de woods.\n\nJOE: Don't y'all know dat hock-bone?\n\nWALTER: How you reckon we gointer know every hock-bone in Orange\nCounty sight unseen?\n\nJOE: (Standing the bone up on the floor of the porch) Dis is a\nhock-bone of Brazzle's ole yaller mule.\n\n(General pleased interest. Everybody wants to touch it.)\n\nBRAZZLE: (Coming forward) Well, sir! (Takes bone in both hands and\nlooks up and down the length of it) If 'tain't my ole mule! This sho\nwas one hell of a mule, too. He'd fight every inch in front of de\nplow ... he'd turn over de mowing machine ... run away wid de\nwagon ... and you better not look like you wanter _ride_ 'im!\n\nLINDSAY: (Laughing) Yeah, I 'member seein' you comin' down de road\njust so ... (He limps wid one hand on his buttocks) one day.\n\nBRAZZLE: Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I'd\ngo in de stable to feed 'im.\n\nWALTER: He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a\nweek's washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang 'em up on his\nhip-bones to dry.\n\nLIGE: I 'member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo' boy to Winter Park\nafter some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin'\ndis mule wid dis basket on his arm.... Whut you reckon dat ole\ncontrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going\nround Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of\ndat basket ... wid de boy still up on his back. (General laughter)\n\nBRAZZLE: Yeah, he up and died one Sat'day just for spite ... but he\nwas too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die\ndecent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and\ndie wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. (He gets\ndown on his back and illustrates.) We drug him out to de swamp wid 'im\ndat way, didn't we, Hambo?\n\nJOE CLARK: I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn't we all go to de\ndraggin' out? More folks went to yo' mule's draggin' out than went to\nlast school closing.... Bet there ain't been a thing right in\nmule-hell for four years.\n\nHAMBO: Been dat long since he been dead?\n\nCLARK: I God, yes. He died de week after I started to cutting' dat new\nground.\n\n(The bone is passing from hand to hand. At last a boy about twelve\ntakes it. He has just walked up and is proudly handling the bone when\na woman's voice is heard off stage right.)\n\nVOICE: Senator! Senator!! Oh, you Senator?\n\nBOY: (Turning displeased mutters) Aw, shux. (Loudly) Ma'm?\n\nVOICE: If you don't come here you better!\n\nSENATOR: Yes ma'am. (He drops bone on ground down stage and trots off\nfrowning.) Soon as we men git to doing something dese wimmen....\n(Exits, right.)\n\n(Enter TEET and BOOTSIE left, clean and primped in voile dresses just\nalike. They speak diffidently and enter store. The men admire them\ncasually.)\n\nLIGE: Them girls done turned out to be right good-looking.\n\nWALTER: Teet ain't as pretty now as she was a few years back. She used\nto be fat as a butter ball wid legs just like two whiskey-kegs. She's\ntoo skinny since she got her growth.\n\nCODY: Ain't none of 'em pretty as dat Miss Daisy. God! She's pretty as\na speckled pup.\n\nLIGE: But she was sho nuff ugly when she was little ... little ole\nhard black knot. She sho has changed since she been away up North. If\nshe ain't pretty now, there ain't a hound dog in Georgy.\n\n(Re-enter SENATOR BAILEY and stops on the steps. He addresses JOE\nCLARK.)\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark....\n\nHAMBO: (To Senator) Ain't you got no manners? We all didn't sleep wid\nyou last night.\n\nSENATOR: (Embarrassed) Good evening, everybody.\n\nALL THE MEN: Good evening, son, boy, Senator, etc.\n\nSENATOR: Mist' Clark, mama said is Daisy been here dis evenin'?\n\nJOE CLARK: Ain't laid my eyes on her. Ain't she working over in\nMaitland?\n\nSENATOR: Yessuh ... but she's off today and mama sent her down here to\nget de groceries.\n\nJOE CLARK: Well, tell yo' ma I ain't seen her.\n\nSENATOR: Well, she say to tell you when she come, to tell her ma say\nshe better git home and dat quick.\n\nJOE CLARK: I will. (Exit BOY right.)\n\nLIGE: Bet she's off somewhere wid Dave or Jim.\n\nWALTER: I don't bet it ... I know it. She's got them two in de\ngo-long.\n\n(Re-enter TEET and BOOTSIE from store. TEET has a letter and BOOTSIE\ntwo or three small parcels. The men look up with interest as they come\nout on the porch.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Whut's dat you got, Teet ... letter from Dave?\n\nTEET: (Flouncing) Naw indeed! It's a letter from my B-I-T-sweetie!\n(Rolls her eyes and hips.)\n\nWALTER: (Winking) Well, ain't Dave yo' B-I-T-sweetie? I thought y'all\nwas 'bout to git married. Everywhere I looked dis summer 'twas you and\nDave, Bootsie and Jim. I thought all of y'all would've done jumped\nover de broomstick by now.\n\nTEET: (Flourishing letter) Don't tell it to me ... tell it to the\never-loving Mr. Albert Johnson way over in Apopka.\n\nBOOTSIE: (Rolling her eyes) Oh, tell 'em 'bout the ever-loving Mr.\nJimmy Cox from Altamont. Oh, I can't stand to see my baby lose.\n\nHAMBO: It's lucky y'all girls done got some more fellers, cause look\nlike Daisy done treed both Jim and Dave at once, or they done treed\nhere one.\n\nTEET: Let her have 'em ... nobody don't keer. They don't handle de \"In\nGod we trust\" lak my Johnson. He's head bellman at de hotel.\n\nBOOTSIE: Mr. Cox got money's grandma and old grandpa change. (The\ngirls exit huffily.)\n\nLINDSAY: (To HAMBO, pseudo-seriously) You oughtn't tease dem gals lak\ndat.\n\nHAMBO: Oh, I laks to see gals all mad. But dem boys is crazy sho nuff.\nBefore Daisy come back here they both had a good-looking gal a piece.\nNow they 'bout to fall out and fight over half a gal a piece. Neither\none won't give over and let de other one have her.\n\nLIGE: And she ain't thinking too much 'bout no one man. (Looks off\nleft.) Here she come now. God! She got a mean walk on her!\n\nWALTER: Yeah, man. She handles a lot of traffic! Oh, mama, throw it in\nde river ... papa'll come git it!\n\nLINDSAY: Aw, shut up, you married men!\n\nLIGE: Man don't go blind cause he gits married, do he? (Enter DAISY\nhurriedly. Stops at step a moment. She is dressed in sheer organdie,\nwhite shoes and stockings.)\n\nDAISY: Good evening, everybody. (Walks up on the porch.)\n\nALL THE MEN: (Very pleasantly) Good evening, Miss Daisy.\n\nDAISY: (To CLARK) Mama sent me after some meal and flour and some\nbacon and sausage oil.\n\nCLARK: Senator been here long time ago hunting you.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Did he? Oo ... Mist' Clark, hurry up and fix it\nfor me. (She starts on in the store.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Giving her his seat) You better wait here, Daisy.\n\n(WALTER kicks LIGE to call his attention to LINDSAY'S attitude)\n\nIt's powerful hot in dat store. Lemme run fetch 'em out to you.\n\nLIGE: (To LINDSAY) _Run!_ Joe Lindsay, you ain't been able to run\nsince de big bell rung. Look at dat gray beard.\n\nLINDSAY: Thank God, I ain't gray all over. I'm just as good a man\nright now as any of you young 'uns. (He hurries on into the store.)\n\nWALTER: Daisy, where's yo' two body guards? It don't look natural to\nsee you thout nary one of 'em.\n\nDAISY: (Archly) I ain't got no body guards. I don't know what you\ntalkin' about.\n\nLIGE: Aw, don' try to come dat over us, Daisy. You know who we talkin'\n'bout all right ... but if you want me to come out flat footed ...\nwhere's Jim and Dave?\n\nDAISY: Ain't they playin' somewhere for de white folks?\n\nLIGE: (To WALTER) Will you listen at dis gal, Walter? (To DAISY) When\nI ain't been long seen you and Dave going down to de Lake.\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) Don't y'all run tell mama where I been.\n\nWALTER: Well, you tell us which one you laks de best and we'll wipe\nour mouf (Gesture) and say nothin'. Dem boys been de best of friends\nall they life, till both of 'em took after you ... then good-bye, Katy\nbar de door!\n\nDAISY: (Affected innocence) Ain't they still playin' and dancin'\ntogether?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but that's 'bout all they do 'gree on these days. That's\nde way it is wid men, young and old.... I don't keer how long they\nbeen friends and how thick they been ... a woman kin come between 'em.\nDavid and Jonather never would have been friends so long if Jonather\nhad of been any great hand wid de wimmen. You ain't never seen no two\nroosters that likes one another.\n\nDAISY: I ain't tried to break 'em up.\n\nWALTER: Course you ain't. You don't have to. All two boys need to do\nis to git stuck on de same girl and they done broke up ... _right\nnow_! Wimmen is something can't be divided equal.\n\n(Re-enter JOE LINDSAY and CLARK with the groceries. DAISY jumps up and\ngrabs the packages.)\n\nLIGE: (To DAISY) Want some of us ... me ... to go long and tote yo'\nthings for you?\n\nDAISY: (Nervously) Naw, mama is riding her high horse today. Long as I\nbeen gone it wouldn't do for me to come walking up wid nobody. (She\nexits hurriedly right.)\n\n(All the men watch her out of sight in silence.)\n\nCLARK: (Sighing) I God, know whut Daisy puts me in de mind of?\n\nHAMBO: No, what? (They all lean together.)\n\nCLARK: I God, a great big mango ... a sweet smell, you know, Th a\nstrong flavor, but not something you could mash up like a strawberry.\nSomething with a body to it.\n\n(General laughter, but not obscene.)\n\nHAMBO: (Admiringly) Joe Clark! I didn't know you had it in you!\n\n(MRS. CLARK enters from store door and they all straighten up\nguiltily)\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to his wife) Now whut do you want? I God, the minute I\nset down, here you come....\n\nMRS. CLARK: Somebody want a stamp, Jody. You know you don't 'low me to\nbove wid de post office. (HE rises sullenly and goes inside the\nstore.)\n\nBRAZZLE: Say, Hambo, I didn't see you at our Sunday School picnic.\n\nHAMBO: (Slicing some plug-cut tobacco) Nope, wan't there dis time.\n\nWALTER: Looka here, Hambo. Y'all Baptist carry dis close-communion\nbusiness too far. If a person ain't half drownded in de lake and half\net up by alligators, y'all think he ain't baptized, so you can't take\ncommunion wid him. Now I reckon you can't even drink lemonade and eat\nchicken perlow wid us.\n\nHAMBO: My Lord, boy, youse just _full_ of words. Now, in de first\nplace, if this year's picnic was lak de one y'all had last year ...\nyou ain't had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big\nole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one\nlemon cut up over de top of it.\n\nLIGE: Man, you sho kin mold 'em!\n\nWALTER: Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat\nchicken, when lo and behold y'all had chitlings! Do Jesus!\n\nLINDSAY: Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat\npicnic, which I do know is right.\n\nWALTER: Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo' pastor musta tried\nto swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come\nlong ... wid de whole deacon's board beating him in de back, trying\nto knock it out his throat.\n\nLIGE: Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy\n'bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy 'bout feeding his face.\nSo his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump-knockers to de grub\non the table, so one day he throwed out some slams 'bout dese\npreachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out.\nHe boy ast him \"Where must I go, papa?\" He says, \"Go on to hell I\nreckon ... I don't keer where you go.\"\n\nSo de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy\nnight and rapped on de door. \"Who dat?\" de old man ast him \"It's me,\nJack.\" De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and\ntole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or\neight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin' and drinkin'.\n\n\"Where you been all dis time, Jack?\" de old man ast him.\n\n\"I been to hell,\" Jack tole him.\n\n\"Tell us how it is down there, Jack.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"It's just like it is here ... you cain't git to de\nfire for de preachers.\"\n\nHAMBO: Boy, you kin lie just like de cross-ties from Jacksonville to\nKey West. De presidin' elder must come round on his circuit teaching\ny'all how to tell 'em, cause you couldn't lie dat good just natural.\n\nWALTER: Can't nobody beat Baptist folks lying ... and I ain't never\nfound out how come you think youse so important.\n\nLINDSAY: Ain't we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia\nBaptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.\n\nLIGE: Thass right, y'all got a heap more church than you got members\nto go in it.\n\nHAMBO: Thass all right ... y'all ain't got neither de church nor de\nmembers. Everything that's had in this town got to be held in our\nchurch.\n\n(Re-enter JOE CLARK.)\n\nCLARK: What you-all talkin'?\n\nHAMBO: Come on out, Tush Hawg, lemme beat you some checkers. I'm tired\nof fending and proving wid dese boys ain't got no hair on they chest\nyet.\n\nCLARK: I God, you mean you gointer get beat. You can't handle me ...\nI'm a tush hawg.\n\nHAMBO: Well, I'm going to draw dem tushes right now. (To two small\nboys using checker board on edge of porch.) Here you chilluns, let de\nMayor and me have that board. Go on out an' play an' give us grown\nfolks a little peace. (The children go down stage and call out:)\n\nSMALL BOY: Hey, Senator. Hey, Marthy. Come on let's play chick-me,\nchick-me, cranie-crow.\n\nCHILD'S VOICE: (Off stage) All right! Come on, Jessie! (Enter several\nchildren, led by SENATOR, and a game begins in front of the store as\nJOE CLARK and HAMBO play checkers.)\n\nJOE CLARK: I God! Hambo, you can't play no checkers.\n\nHAMBO: (As they seat themselves at the check board) Aw, man, if you\nwasn't de Mayor I'd beat you all de time.\n\n(The children get louder and louder, drowning out the men's voices.)\n\nSMALL GIRL: I'm gointer be de hen.\n\nBOY: And I'm gointer be de hawk. Lemme git maself a stick to mark wid.\n\n(The boy who is the hawk squats center stage with a short twig in his\nhand. The largest girl lines up the other children behind her.)\n\nGIRL: (Mother Hen) (Looking back over her flock): Y'all ketch holt of\none 'Nother's clothes so de hawk can't git yuh. (They do.) You all\nstraight now?\n\nCHILDREN: Yeah. (The march around the hawk commences.)\n\nHEN AND CHICKS:\n  Chick mah chick mah craney crow\n  Went to de well to wash ma toe\n  When I come back ma chick was gone\n  What time, ole witch?\n\nHAWK: (Making a tally on the ground) One!\n\nHEN AND CHICKS: (Repeat song and march.)\n\nHAWK: (Scoring again) Two!\n\n(Can be repeated any number of times.)\n\nHAWK: Four. (He rises and imitates a hawk flying and trying to catch a\nchicken. Calling in a high voice:) Chickee.\n\nHEN: (Flapping wings to protect her young) My chickens sleep.\n\nHAWK: Chickee. (During all this the hawk is feinting and darting in\nhis efforts to catch a chicken, and the chickens are dancing\ndefensively, the hen trying to protect them.)\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\nHAWK: I shall have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have a chick.\n\nHAWK: I'm goin' home. (Flies off)\n\nHEN: Dere's de road.\n\nHAWK: My pot's a boilin'.\n\nHEN: Let it boil.\n\nHAWK: My guts a growlin'.\n\nHEN: Let 'em growl.\n\nHAWK: I must have a chick.\n\nHEN: You shan't have n'airn.\n\nHAWK: My mama's sick.\n\nHEN: Let her die.\n\nHAWK: Chickie!\n\nHEN: My chicken's sleep.\n\n(HAWK darts quickly around the hen and grabs a chicken and leads him\noff and places his captive on his knees at the store porch. After a\nbrief bit of dancing he catches another, then a third, etc.)\n\nHAMBO: (At the checker board, his voice rising above the noise of the\nplaying children, slapping his sides jubilantly) Ha! Ha! I got you\nnow. Go ahead on and move, Joe Clark ... jus' go ahead on and move.\n\nLOUNGERS: (Standing around two checker players) Ol' Deacon's got you\nnow.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Don't see how he can beat the Mayor like that.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Got him in the Louisville loop. (These remarks are\ndrowned by the laughter of the playing children directly in front of\nthe porch. MAYOR JOE CLARK disturbed in his concentration on the\ncheckers and peeved at being beaten suddenly turns toward the\nchildren, throwing up his hands.)\n\nCLARK: Get on 'way from here, you limbs of Satan, making all that\nracket so a man can't hear his ears. Go on, go on!\n\n(THE MAYOR looks about excitedly for the town marshall. Seeing him\nplaying cards on the other side of porch, he bellows:)\n\nLum Boger, whyn't you git these kids away from here! What kind of a\nmarshall is you? All this passle of young'uns around here under grown\npeople's feet, creatin' disorder in front of my store.\n\n(LUM BOGER puts his cards down lazily, comes down stage and scatters\nthe children away. One saucy little girl refuses to move.)\n\nLUM BOGER: Why'nt you go on away from here, Matilda? Didn't you hear\nme tell you-all to move?\n\nLITTLE MATILDA: (Defiantly) I ain't goin' nowhere. You ain't none of\nmy mama. (Jerking herself free from him as LUM touches her.) My mama\nin the store and she told me to wait out here. So take that, ol' Lum.\n\nLUM BOGER: You impudent little huzzy, you! You must smell yourself ...\nyouse so fresh.\n\nMATILDA: The wind musta changed and you smell your own top lip.\n\nLUM BOGER: Don't make me have to grab you and take you down a\nbuttonhole lower.\n\nMATILDA: (Switching her little head) Go ahead on and grab me. You sho\ncan't kill me, and if you kill me, you sho can't eat me. (She marches\ninto the store.)\n\nSENATOR: (Derisively from behind stump) Ol' dumb Lum! Hey! Hey!\n\n(LITTLE BOY at edge of stage thumbs his nose at the marshall.)\n\n(LUM lumbers after the small boy. Both exit.)\n\nHAMBO: (To CLARK who has been thinking all this while what move to\nmake) You ain't got but one move ... go ahead on and make it. What's\nde matter, Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Moving his checker) Aw, here.\n\nHAMBO: (Triumphant) Now! Look at him, boys. I'm gonna laugh in notes.\n(Laughing to the scale and jumping a checker each time) Do, sol, fa,\nme, lo ... one! (Jumping another checker) La, sol, fa, me, do ... two!\n(Another jump.) Do sol, re, me, lo ... three! (Jumping a third.) Lo\nsol, fa, me, re ... four! (The crowd begins to roar with laughter. LUM\nBOGER returns, looking on. Children come drifting back again playing\nchick-me-chick-me-cranie crow.)\n\nVOICE: Oh, ha! Done got the ol' tush hog.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Thought you couldn't be beat, Brother Mayor?\n\nCLARK: (Peeved, gets up and goes into the store mumbling) Oh, I coulda\nbeat you if I didn't have this store on my mind. Saturday afternoon\nand I got work to do. Lum, ain't I told you to keep them kids from\nplayin' right in front of this store?\n\n(LUM makes a pass at the nearest half-grown boy. The kids dart around\nhim teasingly.)\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Eh, heh.... Hambo done run him on his store ... done\nrun the ol' coon in his hole.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: That ain't good politics, Hambo, beatin' the Mayor.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, Hambo, you don't got to be so hard at checkers,\ncome on let's see what you can do with de cards. Lum Boger there got\nhis hands full nursin' the chilluns.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (At the table) We ain't playin' for money, nohow,\nDeacon. We just playin' a little Florida Flip.\n\nHAMBO: Ya all can't play no Florida Flip. When I was a sinner there\nwasn't a man in this state could beat me playin' that game. But I'm a\ndeacon in Macedonia Baptist now and I don't bother with the cards no\nmore.\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: All right, then, come on here Tony (To man with\nbasket on steps.) let me catch your jack.\n\nTAYLOR: (Looking toward door) I don't reckon I got time. I guess my\nwife gonna get through buying out that store some time or other and\nwant to go home.\n\nOLD MAN: (On opposite side of porch from card game) I bet my wife\nwould know better than expect me to sit around and wait for her with a\nbasket. Whyn't you tell her to tote it on home herself?\n\nTAYLOR: (Sighing and shaking his head.) Eh, Lawd!\n\nVOICE AT CARD TABLE: Look like we can't get nobody to come into this\ngame. Seem like everybody's scared a us. Come on back here, Lum, and\ntake your hand. (LUM makes a final futile gesture at the children.)\n\nLUM: Ain't I tole you little haitians to stay away from here?\n\n(CHILDREN scatter teasingly only to return to their play in front of\nthe store later on. LUM comes up on the porch and re-joins the card\ngame. Just as he gets seated, MRS. CLARK comes to the door of the\nstore and calls him.)\n\nMRS. CLARK: (Drawlingly) Columbus!\n\nLUM: (Wearily) Ma'am?\n\nMRS. CLARK: De Mayor say for you to go round in de back yard and tie\nup old lady Jackson's mule what's trampin' aup all de tomatoes in my\ngarden.\n\nLUM: All right. (Leaving card game.) Wait till I come back, folkses.\n\nLIGE: Oh, hum! (Yawning and putting down the deck of cards) Lum's sho\na busy marshall. Say, ain't Dave and Jim been round here yet? I feel\nkinder like hearin' a little music 'bout now.\n\nBOY: Naw, they ain't been here today. You-all know they ain't so thick\nnohow as they was since Daisy Bailey come back and they started\nrunnin' after her.\n\nWOMAN: You mean since she started runnin' after them, the young hussy.\n\nMRS. CLARK: (In doorway) She don't mean 'em no good.\n\nWALTER: That's a shame, ain't it now? (Enter LUM from around back of\nstore. He jumps on the porch and takes his place at the card box.)\n\nLUM: (To the waiting players) All right, boys! Turn it on and let the\nbad luck happen.\n\nLIGE: My deal. (He begins shuffling the cards with an elaborate\nfan-shape movement.)\n\nVOICE AT TABLE: Look out there, Lige, you shuffling mighty lot. Don't\ncarry the cub to us.\n\nLIGE: Aw, we ain't gonna cheat you ... we gonna beat you. (He slams\ndown the cards for LUM BOGER to cut.) Wanta cut 'em?\n\nLUM: No, ain't no need of cutting a rabbit out when you can twist him\nout. Deal 'em. (LIGE deals out the cards.)\n\nCLARK'S VOICE: (Inside the store) You, Mattie! (MRS. CLARK, who has\nbeen standing in the DOE, quickly turns and goes inside.)\n\nLIGE: Y-e-e-e! Spades! (The game is started.)\n\nLUM: Didn't snatch that jack, did you?\n\nLIGE: Aw, no, ain't snatched no jack. Play.\n\nWALTER: (LUM'S partner) Well, here it is, partner. What you want me to\nplay for you?\n\nLUM: Play jus' like I'm in New York, partner. But we gotta try to\ncatch that jack.\n\nLIGE: (Threateningly) Stick out your hand and draw back a nub.\n\n(WALTER THOMAS plays.)\n\nWALTER: I'm playin' a diamond for you, partner.\n\nLUM: I done tole you you ain't got no partner.\n\nLIGE: Heh, Heh! Partner, we got 'em. Pull off wid your king. Dey got\nto play 'em. (When that trick is turned, triumphantly:) Didn't I tell\nyou, partner? (Stands on his feet and slams down with his ace\nviolently) Now, come up under this ace. Aw, hah, look at ol' low,\npartner. I knew I was gonna catch 'em. (When LUM plays) Ho, ho, there\ngoes the queen.... Now, the jack's a gentleman.... Now, I'm playin' my\nknots. (Everybody plays and the hand is ended.) Partner, high, low,\njack and the game and four.\n\nWALTER: Give me them cards. I believe you-all done give me the cub\nthat time. Look at me ... this is Booker T Washington dealing these\ncards. (Shuffles cards grandly and gives them to LIGE to cut.) Wanta\ncut 'em?\n\nLIGE: Yeah, cut 'em and shoot 'em. I'd cut behind my ma. (He cuts the\ncards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to player at left, FRANK, LIGE'S partner) What you\nsaying, Frank?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'. (LIGE is trying to peep at cards.)\n\nWALTER: (Turning to LIGE) Stop peepin' at them cards, Lige. (To FRANK)\nDid you say you was beggin' or standin'?\n\nFRANK: I'm beggin'.\n\nWALTER: Get up off your knees. Go ahead and tell 'em I sent you.\n\nFRANK: Well, that makes us four.\n\nWALTER: I don't care if you is. (Pulls a quarter out of his pocket and\nlays it down on the box.) Twenty-five cents says I know the best one.\nLet's go. (Everybody puts down a quarter.)\n\nFRANK: What you want me to play for you partner?\n\nLIGE: Play me a club. (The play goes around to dealer, WALTER, who\ngets up and takes the card off the top of the deck and slams it down\non the table.)\n\nWALTER: Get up ol' deuce of deamonds and gallop off with your load.\n(TO LUM) Partner, how many times you seen the deck?\n\nLUM: Two times.\n\nWALTER: Well, then I'm gonna pull off, partner. Watch this ol' queen.\n(Everyone plays) Ha! Ha! Wash day and no soap. (Takes the jack of\ndiamonds and sticks him up on his forehead. Stands up on his feet.)\nPartner, I'm dumping to you ... play your king. (When it comes to his\nplay LUM, too, stands up. The others get up and they, too, excitedly\nslam their cards down.) Now, come on in this kitchen and let me splice\nthat cabbage! (He slams down the ace of diamonds. Pats the jack on his\nfor head, sings:) Hey, hey, back up, jenny, get your load. (Talking)\nDump to that jack, boys, dump to it. High, low, jack and the game and\nfour. One to go. We're four wid you, boys.\n\nLIGE: Yeah, but you-all playin' catch-up.\n\nFRANK: Gimme them cards ... lemme deal some.\n\nLIGE: Frank, now you really got responsibility on you. They's got one\ngame on us.\n\nFRANK: Aw, man, I'm gonna deal 'em up a mess. This deal's in the White\nHouse. (He shuffles and puts the cards down for WALTER to cut.) Cut\n'em.\n\nWALTER: Nope, I never cut green timber. (FRANK deals and turns the\ncard up.)\n\nFRANK: Hearts, boys. (He turns up an ace.)\n\nLUM: Aw, you snatched that ace, nigger.\n\nWALTER: Yeah, they done carried the cub to us, partner.\n\nLIGE: Oh, he didn't do no such a thing. That ace was turned fair. We\njus' too hard for you ... we eats our dinner out a the blacksmith\nshop.\n\nWALTER: Aw, you all cheatin'. You know it wasn't fair.\n\nFRANK: Aw, shut up, you all jus' whoopin' and hollerin' for nothin'.\nTryin' to bully the game. (FRANK and LIGE rise and shake hands\ngrandly.)\n\nLIGE: Mr. Hoover, you sho is a noble president. We done stuck these\nniggers full of cobs. They done got scared to play us.\n\nLIGE (?) Scared to play you? Get back down to this table, let me\nspread my mess.\n\nLOUNGER: Yonder comes Elder Simms. You all better squat that rabbit.\nThey'll be having you all up in the church for playin' cards.\n\n(FRANK grabs up the cards and puts them in his pocket quickly.\nEverybody picks up the money and looks unconcerned as the preacher\nenters. Enter ELDER SIMMS with his two prim-looking little children by\nthe hand.)\n\nELDER SIMMS: How do, children. Right warm for this time in November,\nain't it?\n\nVOICE: Yes sir, Reverend, sho is. How's Sister Simms?\n\nSIMMS: She's feelin' kinda po'ly today. (Goes on in store with his\nchildren)\n\nVOICE: (Whispering loudly) Don't see how that great big ole powerful\nwoman could be sick. Look like she could go bear huntin' with her\nfist.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: She look jus' as good as you-all's Baptist pastor's\nwife. Pshaw, you ain't seen no big woman, nohow, man. I seen one once\nso big she went to whip her little boy and he run up under her belly\nand hid six months 'fore she could find him.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I knowed a woman so little that she had to get up\non a soap box to look over a grain of sand.\n\n(REV. SIMMS comes out of store, each child behind him sucking a stick\nof candy.)\n\nSIMMS: (To his children) Run on home to your mother and don't get\ndirty on the way. (The two children start primly off down the street\nbut just out of sight one of them utters a loud cry.)\n\nSIMMS'S CHILD: (Off stage) Papa, papa. Nunkie's trying to lick my\ncandy.\n\nSIMMS: I told you to go on and leave them other children alone.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: (Kidding) Lum, whyn't you tend to your business.\n\n(TOWN MARSHALL rises and shoos the children off again.)\n\nLUM: You all varmints leave them nice chillun alone.\n\nLIGE: (Continuing the lying on porch) Well, you all done seen so much,\nbut I bet you ain't never seen a snake as big as the one I saw when I\nwas a boy up in middle Georgia. He was so big couldn't hardly move his\nself. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on him and everybody\nthought he was a log, till one day I set down on him and went to\nsleep, and when I woke up that snake done crawled to Florida. (Loud\nlaughter.)\n\nFRANK: (Seriously) Layin' all jokes aside though now, you all remember\nthat rattlesnake I killed last year was almost as big as that Georgia\nsnake.\n\nVOICE: How big, you say it was, Frank?\n\nFRANK: Maybe not quite as big as that, but jus' about fourteen feet.\n\nVOICE: (Derisively) Gimme that lyin' snake. That snake wasn't but four\nfoot long when you killed him last year and you done growed him ten\nfeet in a year.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: Well, I don't know about that. Some of the snakes\naround here is powerful long. I went out in my front yard yesterday\nright after the rain and killed a great big ol' cottonmouth.\n\nSIMMS: This sho is a snake town. I certainly can't raise no chickens\nfor 'em. They kill my little biddies jus' as fast as they hatch out.\nAnd yes ... if I hadn't cut them weeds out of the street in front of\nmy parsonage, me or some of my folks woulda been snake-bit right at\nour front door. (To whole crowd) Whyn't you all cut down these weeds\nand clean up these streets?\n\nHAMBO: Well, the Mayor ain't said nothin' 'bout it.\n\nSIMMS: When the folks misbehaves in this town I think they oughta lock\n'em up in a jail and make 'em work their fine out on the streets, then\nthese weeds would be cut down.\n\nVOICE: How we gonna do that when we ain't got no jail?\n\nSIMMS: Well, you sho needs a jail ... you-all needs a whole lot of\nimprovements round this town. I ain't never pastored no town so\nway-back as this one here.\n\nCLARK: (Who has lately emerged from the store, fanning himself,\noverhears this last remark and bristles up) What's that you say 'bout\nthis town?\n\nSIMMS: I say we needs some improvements here in this town ... that's\nwhat.\n\nCLARK: (In a powerful voice) And what improvements you figgers we\nneeds?\n\nSIMMS: A whole heap. Now, for one thing we really does need a jail,\nMayor. We oughta stop runnin' these people out of town that\nmisbehaves, and lock 'em up. Others towns has jails, everytown I ever\npastored had a jail. Don't see how come we can't have one.\n\nCLARK: (Towering angrily above the preacher) Now, wait a minute,\nSimms. Don't you reckon the man who knows how to start a town knows\nhow to run it? I paid two hundred dollars out of this right hand for\nthis land and walked out here and started this town befo' you was\nborn. I ain't like some of you new niggers, come here when grapes'\nripe. I was here to cut new ground, and I been Mayor ever since.\n\nSIMMS: Well, there ain't no sense in no one man stayin' Mayor all the\ntime.\n\nCLARK: Well, it's my town and I can be mayor jus' as long as I want\nto. It was me that put this town on the map.\n\nSIMMS: What map you put it on, Joe Clark? I ain't seen it on no map.\n\nCLARK: (Indignant) I God! Listen here, Elder Simms. If you don't like\nthe way I run this town, just' take your flat feets right on out and\ngit yonder crost the woods. You ain't been here long enough to say\nnothin' nohow.\n\nHAMBO: (From a nail keg) Yeah, you Methodist niggers always telling\npeople how to run things.\n\nTAYLOR: (Practically unheard by the others) We do so know how to run\nthings, don't we? Ain't Brother Mayor a Methodist, and ain't the\nschool-teacher a ...? (His remarks are drowned out by the others.)\n\nSIMMS: No, we don't like the way you're runnin' things. Now looka\nhere, (Pointing at the Marshall) You got that lazy Lum Boger here for\nmarshall and he ain't old enough to be dry behind his ears yet ... and\nall these able-bodied means in this town! You won't 'low nobody else\nto run a store 'ceptin' you. And looka yonder (happening to notice the\nstreet light) only street lamp in town, you got in front of your\nplace. (Indignantly) We pay the taxes and you got the lamp.\n\nVILLAGER: Don't you-all fuss now. How come you two always yam-yamming\nat each other?\n\nCLARK: How come this fly-by-night Methodist preacher over here ...\nain't been here three months ... tries to stand up on my store porch\nand tries to tell me how to run my town? (MATTIE CLARK, the Mayor's\nwife, comes timidly to the door, wiping her hands on her apron.) Ain't\nno man gonna tell me how to run my town. I God, I 'lected myself in\nand I'm gonna run it. (Turns and sees wife standing in door.\nCommandingly.) I God, Mattie, git on back in there and wait on that\nstore!\n\nMATTIE: (Timidly) Jody, somebody else wantin' stamps.\n\nCLARK: I God, woman, what good is you? Gwan, git in. Look like between\nwomen and preachers a man can't have no peace. (Exit CLARK.)\n\nSIMMS: (Continuing his argument) Now, when I pastored in Jacksonville\nyou oughta see what kinda jails they got there....\n\nLOUNGER: White folks needs jails. We colored folks don't need no jail.\n\nANOTHER VILLAGER: Yes, we do, too. Elder Simms is right....\n\n(The argument becomes a hubbub of voices.)\n\nTAYLOR: (Putting down his basket) Now, I tell you a jail....\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: (Emerging from the store door, arms full of groceries,\nlooking at her husband) Yeah, and if you don't shut up and git these\nrations home I'm gonna be worse on you than a jail and six judges.\nPickup that basket and let's go. (TONY meekly picks up the basket and\nhe and his wife exit as the sound of an approaching guitar is heard\noff stage.)\n\n(Two carelessly dressed, happy-go-lucky fellows enter together. One is\nfingering a guitar without playing any particular tune, and the other\nhas his hat cocked over his eyes in a burlesque, dude-like manner.\nThere are casual greetings.)\n\nWALTER: Hey, there, bums, how's tricks?\n\nLIGE: What yo' sayin', boys?\n\nHAMBO: Good evenin' sons.\n\nLIGE: How did you-all make out this evenin', boys?\n\nJIM: Oh, them white folks at the party shelled out right well. Kept\nDave busy pickin' it up. How much did we make today, Dave?\n\nDAVE: (Striking his pocket) I don't know, boy, but feels right heavy\nhere. Kept me pickin' up money just like this.... (As JIM picks a few\ndance chords, Dave gives a dance imitation of how he picked up the\ncoins from the ground as the white folks threw them.) We count it\nafter while. Woulda divided up with you already if you hadn't left me\nwhen you seen Daisy comin' by. Let's sit down on the porch and rest\nnow.\n\nLIGE: She sho is lookin' stylish and pretty since she come back with\nher white folks from up North. Wearin' the swellest clothes. And that\ncoal-black hair of hers jus' won't quit.\n\nMATTIE CLARK: (In doorway) I don't see what the mens always hanging\nafter Daisy Taylor for.\n\nCLARK: (Turning around on the porch) I God, you back here again. Who's\ntendin' that store? (MATTIE disappears inside.)\n\nDAVE: Well, she always did look like new money to me when she was here\nbefore.\n\nJIM: Well, that's all you ever did get was a look.\n\nDAVE: That's all you know! I bet I get more than that now.\n\nJIM: You might git it but I'm the man to use it. I'm a bottom fish.\n\nDAVE: Aw, man. You musta been walking round here fast asleep when\nDaisy was in this county last. You ain't seen de go I had with her.\n\nJIM: No, I ain't seen it. Bet you didn't have no letter from her while\nshe been away.\n\nDAVE: Bet you didn't neither.\n\nJIM: Well, it's just cause she can't write. If she knew how to scratch\nwith a pencil I'd had a ton of 'em.\n\nDAVE: Shaw, man! I'd had a post office full of 'em.\n\nOLD WOMAN: You-all ought to be shame, carrying on over a brazen heifer\nlike Daisy Taylor. Jus' cause she's been up North and come back, I\nreckon you cutting de fool sho 'nough now. She ain't studying none of\nyou-all nohow. All she wants is what you got in your pocket.\n\nJIM: I likes her but she won't git nothin' outa me. She never did. I\nwouldn't give a poor consumpted cripple crab a crutch to cross the\nRiver Jurdon.\n\nDAVE: I know I ain't gonna give no woman nothin'. I wouldn't give a\ndog a doughnut if he treed a terrapin.\n\nLIGE: Youse a cottontail dispute ... both of you. You'd give her\nanything you got. You'd give her Georgia with a fence 'round it.\n\nOLD MAN: Yeah, and she'd take it, too.\n\nLINDSAY: Don't distriminate the woman like that. That ain't nothing\nbut hogism. Ain't nothin' the matter with Daisy, she's all right.\n\n(Enter TEETS and BOOTSIE tittering coyly and switching themselves.)\n\nBOOTSIE: Is you seen my mama?\n\nOLD WOMAN: You know you ain't lookin' for no mama. Jus' come back down\nhere to show your shape and fan around awhile. (BOOTSIE and TEETS\ngoing into the store.)\n\nBOOTSIE & TEETS: No, we ain't. We'se come to get our mail.\n\nOLD WOMAN: (After girls enter store) Why don't you all keep up some\nattention to these nice girls here, Bootsie and Teets. They wants to\nmarry.\n\nDAVE: Aw, who thinkin' 'bout marryin' now? They better stay home and\neat their own pa's rations. I gotta buy myself some shoes.\n\nJIM: The woman I'm gonna marry ain't born yet and her maw is dead.\n\n(GIRLS come out giggling and exit.) (JIM begins to strum his guitar\nlightly at first as the talk goes on.)\n\nCLARK: (To DAVE and JIM) Two of the finest gals that ever lived and\nfriendly jus' like you-all is. You two boys better take 'em back and\nstop them shiftless ways.\n\nHAMBO: Yeah, hurry up and do somethin'! I wants to taste a piece yo'\nweddin' cake.\n\nJIM: (Embarrassed but trying to be jocular) Whut you trying to rush\nme up so fast?... Look at Will Cody here (Pointing to little man on\nporch) he been promising to bring his already wife down for two\nmonths ... and nair one of us ain't seen her yet.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, how you speck me to haul in a brand new wife when he can't\nlead a wagon-broke wife eighteen miles? Me, I'm going git one soon's\nCody show me his'n. (General sly laughter at CODY'S expense.)\n\nWALTER: (Snaps his fingers and pretends to remember something) Thass\nright, Cody. I been intending to tell you.... I know where you kin buy\na ready-built house for you and yo' wife. (Calls into the store.) Hey,\nClark, cime on out here and tell Cody 'bout dat Bradley house. (To\nCODY.) I know you wants to git a place of yo' own so you kin settle\ndown.\n\nHAMBO: He done moved so much since he been here till every time he\nwalk out in his back yeard his chickens lay down and cross they legs.\n\nLINDSAY: Cody, I thought you tole us you was going up to Sanford to\nbring dat 'oman down here last Sat'day.\n\nLIGE: That ain't de way he tole me 'bout it. Look, fellers, (Getting\nup and putting one hand on his hips and one finger of the other hand\nagainst his chin coquettishly) Where you reckon I'll be next Sat'day\nnight?... Sittin' up side of Miz Cody. (Great burst of laughter.)\n\nSYKES JONES: (Laughing) Know what de folks tole me in Sanford? Dat was\nanother man's wife. (Guffaws.)\n\nCODY: (Feebly) Aw, you don't know whut you talkin' bout.\n\nJONES: Naw, I don't know, but de folks in Sanford does. (Laughing) Dey\ntell me when dat lady's husband come home Sat'day night, ole Cody\njumped out de window. De man grabbed his old repeater and run out in\nde yard to head him off. When Cody seen him come round de corner de\nhouse (Gesture) he flopped his wings and flew up on de fence. De man\nthowed dat shotgun dead on him. (Laughs) Den, man! Cody flopped his\nwings lak a buzzard (Gesture) and sailed on off. De man dropped to his\nknees lak dis (Gesture of kneeling on one knee and taking aim) Die!\ndie! die! (Supposedly sound of shots as the gun is moved in a circle\nfollowing the course of Cody's supposed flight) Cody just flew right\non off and lit on a hill two miles off. Then, man! (Gesture of swift\nflight) In ten minutes he was back here in Eatonville and in he bed.\n\nWALTER: I passed there and seen his house shakin', but I didn't know\nhow come.\n\nHAMBO: Aw, leave de boy alone.... If you don't look out some of y'all\ngoing to have to break his record.\n\nLIGE: I'm prepared to break it now. (General laughter.)\n\nJIM: Well, anyhow, I don't want to marry and leave Dave ... yet\nawhile. (Picking a chord.)\n\nDAVE: And I ain't gonna leave Jim. We been palling around together\never since we hollered titty mama, ain't we, boy?\n\nJIM: Sho is. (Music of the guitar increases in volume. DAVE shuffles a\nfew steps and the two begin to sing.)\n\nJIM:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  I ain't got no dog.\n  How am I gonna git him?\n  God knows.\n\nDAVE:\n  Rabbit on the log.\n  Ain't got no dog.\n  Shoot him with my rifle\n  Bam! Bam!\n\n(Some of the villagers join in song and others get up and march around\nthe porch in time with the music. BOOTSIE and TEETS re-enter, TEETS\nsticking her letter down the neck of her blouse. JOE LINDSAY grabs\nTEETS and WALTER THOMAS grabs BOOTSIE. There is dancing, treating and\ngeneral jollification. Little children dance the parse-me-la. The\nmusic fills the air just as the sun begins to go down. Enter DAISY\nTAYLOR coming down the road toward the store.)\n\nCLARK: (Bawls out from the store porch) I God, there's Daisy again.\n\n(Most of the dancing stops, the music slows down and then stops\ncompletely. DAVE and JIM greet DAISY casually as she approaches the\nporch.)\n\nJIM: Well, Daisy, we knows you, too.\n\nDAVE: Gal, youse jus' as pretty as a speckled pup.\n\nDAISY: (Giggling) I see you two boys always playin' and singin'\ntogether. That music sounded right good floating down the road.\n\nJIM: Yeah, child, we'se been playin' for the white folks all week.\nWe'se playin' for the colored now.\n\nDAVE: (Showing off, twirling his dancing feet) Yeah, we're standin' on\nour abstract and livin' on our income.\n\nOLD MAN: Um-ump, but they ain't never workin'. Just round here playing\nas usual.\n\nJIM: Some folks think you ain't workin' lessen you smellin' a mule.\n(He sits back down on box and picks at his guitar.) Think you gotta\nbe beatin' a man to his barn every mornin'.\n\nVOICE: Glad to be round home with we-all again, ain't you Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Is I glad? I jus' got off special early this evenin' to come\nover here and see everybody. I was kinda 'fraid sundown would catch me\n'fore I got round that lake. Don't know how I'm gonna walk back to my\nworkin' place in the dark by muself.\n\nDAVE: Don't no girl as good-lookin' as you is have to go home by\nherself tonight.\n\nJIM: No, cause I'm here.\n\nDAVE: (To DAISY) Don't you trust yourself round that like wid all them\n'gators and moccasins with that nigger there, Daisy (Pointing at JIM)\nHe's jus' full of rabbit blood. What you need is a real man ... with\ngood feet. (Cutting a dance step.)\n\nDAISY: I ain't thinking 'bout goin' home yet. I'm goin' in the store.\n\nJIM: What you want in the store?\n\nDAISY: I want some gum.\n\nDAVE: (Starting toward door) Girl, you don't have to go in there to\ngit no gum. I'll go in there and buy you a carload of gum. What kind\nyou want?\n\nDAISY: Bubble gum. (DAVE goes in the store with his hand in his\npocket. The sun is setting and the twilight deepens.)\n\nJIM: (Pulling package out of his pocket and laughing) Here your gum,\nbaby. What it takes to please the ladies, I totes it. I don't have to\ngo get it, like Dave. What you gimme for it?\n\nDAISY: A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck. (She embraces\nJIM playfully. He hands her the gum, patting his shoulder as he sits\non box.) Oh, thank you. Youse a ready man.\n\nJIM: Yeah, there's a lot of good parts to me. You can have West Tampa\nif you want it.\n\nDAISY: You always was a nice quiet boy, Jim.\n\nDAVE: (Emerging from the store with a package of gum) Here's your gum,\nDaisy.\n\nJIM: Oh, youse late. She's done got gum now. Chaw that yourself.\n\nDAVE: (Slightly peeved and surprised) Hunh, you mighty fast here now\nwith Daisy but you wasn't that fast gettin' out of that white man's\nchicken house last week.\n\nJIM: Who you talkin' 'bout?\n\nDAVE: Hoo-oo? (Facetiously) You ain't no owl. Your feet don't fit no\nlimb.\n\nJIM: Aw, nigger, hush.\n\nDAVE: Aw, hush, yourself. (He walks away for a minute as DAISY turns\nto meet some newcomers. DAVE throws his package of gum down on the\nground. It breaks and several children scramble for the pieces. An old\nman, very drunk, carrying an empty jug enters on left and staggers\ntipsily across stage.) (MAYOR JOE CLARK emerges from the store and\nlooks about for his marshall.)\n\nCLARK: (Bellowing) Lum Boger!\n\nLUM BOGER: (Eating a stalk of cane) Yessir!\n\nCLARK: I God, Lum, take your lazy self off that keg and go light that\ntown lamp. All summer long you eatin' up my melon, and all winter long\nyou chawin' up my cane. What you think this town is payin' you for?\nLaying round here doin' nothin'? Can't you see it's gettin' dark?\n\n(LUM BOGER rises lazily and takes the soap box down stage, stands on\nit to light the lamp, discovers no oil in it and goes in store. In a\nfew moments he comes out of store, fills the lamp and lights it.)\n\nDAISY: (Coming back toward JIM) Ain't you all gonna play and sing a\nlittle somethin' for me? I ain't heard your all's music much for so\nlong.\n\nJIM: Play anything you want, Daisy. Don't make no difference what 'tis\nI can pick it. Where's that old coon, Dave? (Looking around for his\npartner.)\n\nLIGE: (Calling Dave, who is leaning against post at opposite end of\nporch) Come here, an' get warmed up for Daisy.\n\nDAVE: Aw, ma throat's tired.\n\nJIM: Leave the baby be.\n\nDAISY: Come on, sing a little, Dave.\n\nDAVE: (Going back toward Jim) Well, seeing who's asking ... all right.\nWhat song yo like, Daisy?\n\nDAISY: Um-m. Lemme think.\n\nVOICE ON PORCH: \"Got on the train, didn't have no fare\".\n\nDAISY: (Gaily) Yes, that one. That's a good one.\n\nJIM: (Begins to tune up. DAVE touches Daisy's hand.)\n\nVOICE: (In fun) Hunh, you all wouldn't play at the hall last week when\nwe asked you.\n\nVOICE OF SPITEFUL OLD WOMAN: Daisy wasn't here then.\n\nANOTHER VOICE: (Teasingly) All you got to do to some men is to shake a\nskirt tail in their face and they goes off their head.\n\nDAVE: (To JIM who is still tuning up) Come if you're comin' boy, let's\ngo if you gwine. (The full melody of the guitar comes out in a lively,\nold-fashioned tune.)\n\nVOICE: All right now, boys, do it for Daisy jus' as good as you do for\ndem white folks over in Maitland.\n\nDAVE & JIM: (Beginning to sing)\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Got on the train,\n  Didn't have no fare,\n  Conductor asked me what I'm doin' there,\n  But I rode some!\n\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck\n  And led me to the door.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  Grabbed me by the neck,\n  And led me to the door.\n  Rapped me cross the head with a forty-four,\n  But I rode some.\n\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  First thing I saw in jail\n  Was a pot of peas.\n  But I rode some,\n  But I rode some.\n  The peas was good,\n  The meat was fat,\n  Fell in love with the chain gang jus' for that,\n  But I rode some.\n\n(DAVE acts out the song in dancing pantomime and when it ends there\nare shouts and general exclamations of approval from the crowd.)\n\nVOICES: I don't blame them white folks for goin' crazy 'bout that....\n\nOLD MAN: Oh, when I was a young boy I used to swing the gals round on\nthat piece.\n\nDAISY: (TO JIM) Seem like your playin' gits better and better.\n\nDAVE: (Quickly) And how 'bout my singin'? (Everybody laughs.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: Ha! Ha! Ol' Dave's gittin' jealous when she\nspeaks o' Jim.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE, in fun) Ain't nothin' to it but my playin'. You ain't\ngot no singin' voice. If that's singin', God's a gopher.\n\nDAVE: (Half-seriously) My singin' is a whole lot better'n your\nplayin'. You jus' go along and fram. The reason why the white folks\ngives us money is cause I'm singin'.\n\nJIM: Yeah?\n\nDAVE: And you can't dance.\n\nVOICE IN THE CROWD: You oughta dance. Big as your feet is, Dave.\n\nDAISY: (Diplomatically) Both of you all is wonderful and I would like\nto see Dave dance a little.\n\nDAVE: There now, I told you. What did I tell you. (To JIM) Stop\nwoofing and pick a little tune there so that I can show Daisy\nsomethin'.\n\nJIM: Pick a tune? I bet if you fool with me I'll pick your bones jus'\nlike a buzzard did the rabbit. You can't sing and now you wants to\ndance.\n\nDAVE: Yeah, and I'll lam your head. Come on and play,\ngood-for-nothing.\n\nJIM: All right, then. You say you can dance ... show these people what\nyou can do. But don't bring that little stuff I been seein' you doin'\nall these years. (JIM plays and DAVE dances, various members of the\ncrowd keep time with their hands and feet, DAISY looks on enjoying\nherself immensely.)\n\nDAISY: (As DAVE cuts a very fancy step) I ain't seen nothin' like this\nup North. Dave you sho hot.\n\n(As DAVE cuts a more complicated step the crowd applauds, but just as\nthe show begins to get good, suddenly JIM stops playing.)\n\nDAVE: (Surprised) What's the matter, buddy?\n\nJIM: (Envious of the attention DAVE has been getting from DAISY,\ndisgustedly) Oh, nigger, I'm tired of seein' you cut the fool. 'Sides\nthat, I been playin' all afternoon for the white folks.\n\nDAISY: But I though you was playin' for me now, Jim.\n\nJIM: Yeah, I'd play all night long for you, but I'm gettin' sick of\nDave round here showin' off. Let him git somethin' and play for\nhimself if he can. (An OLD MAN with a lighted lantern enters.)\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Well, honey, play some more for me, then, and don't\nmind Dave. I reckon he done danced enough. Play me \"Shake That\nThing\".\n\nOLD MAN WITH LANTERN: Sho, you ain't stopped, is you, boy? Music sound\nmighty good floatin' down that dark road.\n\nOLD WOMAN: Yeah, Jim, go on play a little more. Don't get to acting so\nniggerish this evening.\n\nDAVE: Aw, let the ol' darky alone. Nobody don't want to hear him play,\nnohow. I know I don't.\n\nJIM: Well, I'm gonna play. (And he begins to pick \"Shake That Thing\".\nTEETS and BOOTSIE begin to dance with LIGE MOSELY and FRANK WARRICK.\nAs the tune gets good, DAVE cannot resist the music either.)\n\nDAVE: Old nigger's eveil but he sho can play. (He begins to do a few\nsteps by himself, then twirls around in front of DAISY and approaches\nher. DAISY, overcome by the music, begins to step rhythmically toward\nDAVE and together they dance unobserved by JIM, absorbed in picking\nhis guitar.)\n\nDAISY: Look here, baby, at this new step I learned up North.\n\nDAVE: You can show me anything, sugar lump.\n\nDAISY: Hold me tight now. (But just as they begin the new movement JIM\nnotices DAISY and DAVE. He stops playing again and lays his guitar\ndown.)\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD: (Disgustedly) Aw, come on, Jim.... You must be\njealous....\n\nJIM: No, I ain't jealous. I jus' get tired of seein' that ol' nigger\nclownin' all the time.\n\nDAVE: (Laughing and pointing to JIM on porch) Look at that mad baby.\nTake that lip up off the ground. Got your mouth stuck out jus' because\nsome one is enjoying themselves. (He comes up and pushes JIM\nplayfully.)\n\nJIM: You better go head and let me alone. (TO DAISY) Come here,\nDaisy!\n\nLIGE: That's just what I say. Niggers can't have no fun without\nsomeone getting mad ... specially over a woman.\n\nJIM: I ain't mad.... Daisy, 'scuse me, honey, but that fool, Dave....\n\nDAVE: I ain't mad neither.... Jim always tryin' to throw off on me.\nBut you can't joke him.\n\nDAISY: (Soothingly) Aw, now, now!\n\nJIM: You ain't jokin'. You means that, nigger. And if you tryin' to\nget hot, first thing, you can pull of my blue shirt you put on this\nmorning.\n\nDAVE: Youse a got that wrong. I ain't got on no shirt of yours.\n\nJIM: Yes, you is got on my shirt, too. Don't tell me you ain't got on\nmy shirt.\n\nDAVE: Well, even if I is, you can just lift your big plantations out\nof my shoes. You can just foot it home barefooted.\n\nJIM: You try to take any shoes offa me!\n\nLIGE: (Pacifying them) Aw, there ain't no use of all that. What you\nall want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin'.\n\nJIM: Nobody's quarreling.... I'm just playin' a little for Daisy and\nDave's out there clownin' with her.\n\nCLARK: (In doorway) I ain't gonna have no fussin' round my store, no\nway. Shut up, you all.\n\nJIM: Well, Mayor Clark, I ain't mad with him. We'se been friends all\nour lives. He's slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub....\n\nDAVE: I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your\nbelly full of my grandma's collard greens. You done et my meat and\nbread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish-heads.\n\nJIM: I'd rather eat stewed fish-heads than steal out of other folkses\nhouses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one\nnight and broke up the settin' hen. (Loud laughter from the crowd)\n\nDAVE: Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody's chickens. I didn't\nhave to. But you ... 'fore you started goin' around with me, playin'\nthat little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth.\nIf it wasn't for these white folks throwin' _me_ money for _my_\ndancin', you would be thin as a whisper right now.\n\nJIM: (Laughing sarcastically) Your dancin'! You been leapin' around\nhere like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody\nwas payin' no 'tention to you, till I come along playing.\n\nLINDSAY: Boys, boys, that ain't no way for friends to carry on.\n\nDAISY: Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin' and carryin' on\nI'm goin' home. 'Bout time for me to be gittin' back to my white folks\nanyhow. It's dark now. I'm goin', even if I have to go by myself. I\nshouldn't a stopped by here nohow.\n\nJIM: (Stopping his quarrel) You ain't gonna go home by yourself. I'm\ngoin' with you.\n\nDAVE: (Singing softly)\n  It may be so,\n  I don't know.\n  But it sounds to me\n  Like a lie.\n\nWALTER: Dave ain't' got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.\n\nDAVE: Tell 'em 'bout me. (Turns to DAISY) Won't you choose a treat on\nme, Miss Daisy, 'fore we go?\n\nDAISY: (Coyly) Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.\n\n(DAVE pulls his hat down over his eyes, whirls around and offers his\narm to DAISY. They strut into the store, DAVE gazing contemptuously at\nJIM as he passes. Crowd roars with laughter, much to the embarrassment\nof JIM.)\n\nLIGE: Ol' fast Dave jus' runnin' the hog right over you, Jim.\n\nWALTER: Thought you was such a hot man.\n\nLUM BOGER: Want me to go in there and put Daisy under arrest and bring\nher to you?\n\nJIM: (Sitting down on the edge of porch with one foot on the step and\nlights a cigarette pretending not to be bothered.) Aw, I'll get her\nwhen I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that\nlake and down the railroad with her by and by.\n\n(DAVE and DAISY emerge from the store, each holding a bottle of red\nsoda pop and laughing together. As they start down the steps DAVE\naccidentally steps on JIM's outstretched foot. JIM jumps up and pushes\nDAVE back, causing him to spill the red soda all over his white shirt\nfront.)\n\nJIM: Stay off my foot, you big ox.\n\nDAVE: Well, you don't have to wet me all up, do you, and me in\ncompany? Why don't you put your damn foot in your pocket?\n\nDAISY: (Wiping DAVE'S shirt front with her handkerchief) Aw, ain't\nthat too bad.\n\nJIM: (To DAVE) Well, who's shirt did I wet? It's mine, anyhow, ain't\nit?\n\nDAVE: (Belligerently) Well, if it's your shirt, then you come take it\noff me. I'm tired of your lip.\n\nJIM: Well, I will.\n\nDAVE: Well, put your fist where you lip is. (Pushing DAISY aside.)\n\nDAISY: (Frightened) I want to go home. Now, don't you all boys fight.\n\n(JIM attempts to come up the steps. DAVE pushes him back and he\nstumbles and falls in the dust. General excitement as the crowd senses\na fight.)\n\nLITTLE BOY: (On the edge of crowd) Fight, fight, you're no kin. Kill\none another, won't be no sin. Fight, fight, you're no kin.\n\n(JIM jumps up and rushes for DAVE as the latter starts down the steps.\nDAVE meets him with his fist squarely in the face and causes him to\nstep backward, confused.)\n\nDAISY: (Still on porch, half crying) Aw, my Lawd! I want to go home.\n\n(General hubbub, women's cries of \"Don't let 'em fight.\" \"Why don't\nsomebody stop 'em?\" \"What kind of men is you all, sit there and let\nthem boys fight like that.\" Men's voices urging the fight: \"Aw, let\n'em fight.\" \"Go for him, Dave.\" \"Slug him, Jim.\"\n\nJIM makes another rush toward the steps. He staggers DAVE. DAVE knocks\nJIM sprawling once more. This time JIM grabs the mule bone as he\nrises, rushes DAVE, strikes DAVE over the head with it and knocks him\nout. DAVE falls prone on his back. There is great excitement.)\n\nOLD WOMAN: (Screams) Lawdy, is he kilt? (Several men rush to the\nfallen man.)\n\nVOICE: Run down to the pump and get a dipper o' water.\n\nCLARK: (To his wife in door) Mattie, come out of that store with a\nbottle of witch hazely oil quick as you can. Jim Weston, I'm gonna\narrest you for this. You Lum Boger. Where is that marshall? Lum Boger!\n(LUM BOGER detaches himself from the crowd.) Arrest Jim.\n\nLUM: (Grabs JIM'S arm, relieves him of the mule bone and looks\nhelplessly at the Mayor.) Now I got him arrested, what's I going to do\nwith him?\n\nCLARK: Lock him up back yonder in my barn till Monday when we'll have\nthe trial in de Baptist Church.\n\nLINDSAY: Yeah, just like all the rest of them Methodists ... always\ntryin' to take undercurrents on people.\n\nWALTER: Ain't no worse then some of you Baptists, nohow. You all don't\nrun this town. We got jus' as much to say as you have.\n\nCLARK: (Angrily to both men) Shut up! Done had enough arguing in front\nof my place. (To LUM BOGER) Take that boy on and lock him up in my\nbarn. And save that mule bone for evidence.\n\n(LUM BOGER leads JIM off toward the back of the store. A crowd follows\nhim. Other men and women are busy applying restoratives to DAVE. DAISY\nstands alone, unnoticed in the center of the stage.)\n\nDAISY: (Worriedly) Now, who's gonna take me home?\n\n\n:::: CURTAIN::::\n\n\n\n\nACT TWO\n\n\nSCENE I\n\nSETTING: Village street scene; huge oak tree upstage center; a house\nor two on back drop. When curtain goes up, Sister LUCY TAYLOR is seen\nstanding under the tree. She is painfully spelling it out.\n\n(Enter SISTER THOMAS, a younger woman (In her thirties) at left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Evenin', Sis Taylor.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Evenin'. (Returns to the notice)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Whut you doin'? Readin' dat notice Joe Clark put up\n'bout de meeting? (Approaches tree)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Is dat whut it says? I ain't much on readin' since I\nhad my teeth pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you\nruins' yo' eye sight. (Turns back to notice) Whut it say?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: (Reading notice) \"The trial of Jim Weston for assault\nand battery on Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at\nMacedonia Baptist Church on Monday, November 10, at three o'clock. All\nare welcome. By order of J. Clark, Mayor of Eatonville, Florida.\"\n(Turning to SISTER TAYLOR) Hit's makin' on to three now.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: You mean it's right _now_. (Looks up at sun to tell\ntime) Lemme go git ready to be at de trial 'cause I'm sho goin' to be\nthere an' I ain't goin' to bite my tongue neither.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I done went an' crapped a mess of collard greens for\nsupper. I better go put 'em on 'cause Lawd knows when we goin' to git\nouta there an' my husband is one of them dat's gointer eat don't keer\nwhut happen. I bet if judgment day was to happen tomorrow he'd speck I\norter fix him a bucket to carry long. (She moves to exit, right)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: All men favors they guts, chile. But what you think of\nall dis mess they got goin' on round here?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I just think it's a sin an' a shame befo' de livin'\njustice de way dese Baptis' niggers is runnin' round here carryin' on.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Oh, they been puttin' out the brags ever since Sat'day\nnight 'bout whut they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this\ntown. They tell me Rev. CHILDERS preached a sermon on it yistiddy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lawd help us! He can't preach an' he look like 10 cents\nworth of have-mercy let lone gittin' up dere tryin' to throw slams at\nus. Now all Elder Simms done wuz to explain to us our rights ... whut\nyou think 'bout Joe Clarke runnin' round here takin' up for these ole\nBaptist niggers?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: De puzzle-gut rascal ... we oughter have him up in\nconference an' put him out de Methdis' faith. He don't b'long in\nthere--wanter tun dat boy outa town for nothin'.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa\ntown--hit's to dig de foundation out from under Elder Simms.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Whut he wants do dat for?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: 'Cause he wants to be a God-know-it-all an' a\nGod-do-it-all an' Simms is de onliest one in this town whut will buck\nup to him.\n\n(Enter SISTER JONES, walking leisurely)\n\nSISTER JONES: Hello, Hoyt, hello, Lucy.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Goin' to de meetin'?\n\nSISTER JONES: Done got my clothes on de line an' I'm bound to be dere.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Gointer testify for Jim?\n\nSISTER JONES: Naw, I reckon--don't make such difference to me which\nway de drop fall.... 'Tain't neither one of 'em much good.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain't de point. De\ncrow we wants to pick is: Is we gointer set still an' let dese Baptist\ntell us when to plant an' when to pluck up?\n\nSISTER JONES: Dat is something to think about when you come to think\n'bout it. (Starts to move on) Guess I better go ahead--see y'all later\nan tell you straighter.\n\n(Enter ELDER SIMMS, right, walking fast, Bible under his arm, almost\ncollides with SISTER JONES as she exits.)\n\nSIMMS: Oh, 'scuse me, Sister Jones. (She nods and smiles and exits.)\nHow you do, Sister Taylor, Sister Thomas.\n\nBOTH: Good evenin', Elder.\n\nSIMMS: Sho is a hot day.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Yeah, de bear is walkin' de earth lak a natural man.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Reverend, look like you headed de wrong way. It's\nalmost time for de trial an' youse all de dependence we got.\n\nSIMMS: I know it. I'm tryin' to find de marshall so we kin go after\nJim. I wants a chance to talk wid him a minute before court sets.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Y'think he'll come clear?\n\nSIMMS: (Proudly) I _know_ it! (Shakes the Bible) I'm goin' to law 'em\nfrom Genesis to Revelation.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Give it to 'em, Elder. Wear 'em out!\n\nSIMMS: We'se liable to havea new Mayor when all dis dust settle. Well,\nI better scuffle on down de road. (Exits, left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Lord, lemme gwan home an' put dese greens on. (Looks\noff stage left) Here come Mayor Clark now, wid his belly settin' out\nin front of him like a cow catcher! His name oughter be Mayor Belly.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: (Arms akimbo) Jus' look at him! Tryin' to look like a\njigadier Breneral.\n\n(Enter CLARK hot and perspiring. They look at him coldly.)\n\nCLARK: I God, de bear got me! (Silence for a moment) How y'all\nfeelin', ladies?\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Brother Mayor, I ain't one of these folks dat bite my\ntongue an' bust my gall--whut's inside got to come out! I can't see to\nmy rest why you cloakin' in wid dese Baptist buzzards 'ginst yo' own\nchurch.\n\nMAYOR CLARK: I ain't cloakin' in wid _none_. I'm de Mayor of dis whole\ntown I stands for de right an' ginst de wrong--I don't keer who it\nkill or cure.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: You think it's right to be runnin' dat boy off for\nnothin'?\n\nCLARK: I God! You call knockin' a man in de head wid a mule bone\nnothin'? 'Nother thin; I done missed nine of my best-layin' hens. I\nain't sayin' Jim got 'em, but different people has tole me he burries\na powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I'm a ruint man!\n(He starts towards the right exit, but LUM BOGER enters right.) I God,\nLum, I been lookin' for you all day. It's almost three o'clock. (Hands\nhim a key from his ring) Take dis key an' go fetch Jim Weston on to de\nchurch.\n\nLUM: Have you got yo' gavel from de lodge-room?\n\nCLARK: I God, that's right, Lum. I'll go get it from de lodge room\nwhilst you go git de bone an' de prisoner. Hurry up! You walk like\ndead lice droppin' off you. (He exits right while LUM crosses stage\ntowards left.)\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Lum, Elder Simms been huntin' you--he's gone on down\n'bout de barn. (She gestures)\n\nLUM BOGER: I reckon I'll overtake him. (Exit left.)\n\nSISTER THOMAS: I better go put dese greens on. My husband will kill me\nif he don't find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter\nfeel like a penny's worth of have-mercy wid all dis stink behind her\ndaughter.\n\nSISTER TAYLOR: Chile, some folks don't keer. They don't raise they\nchillun; they drags 'em up. God knows if dat Daisy wuz mine, I'd throw\nher down an' put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow-line. Here\nshe come in de store Sat'day night (Acts coy and coquettish,\nburlesques DAISY'S walk) a wringing and a twisting!\n\n(Enter MRS. BLUNT, left.)\n\nMRS. BLUNT: How y'all sisters?\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Oh, so-so.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: I'm kickin', but not high.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, thank God you still on prayin' ground an' in a Bible\ncountry. Me, I ain't so many today. De niggers got my Daisy's name all\nmixed up in dis mess.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You musn't mind dat, Sister Blunt. People jus' _will_\ntalk. They's talkin' in New York an' they's talkin' in Georgy an'\nthey's talkin' in Italy.\n\nSISTER THOMAS: Chile, if you talk folkses talk, they'll have you in de\ngraveyard or in Chattahoochee one. You can't pay no 'tention to talk.\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Well, I know one thing. De man or women, chick or child,\ngrizzly or gray, that tells me to my face anything wrong 'bout _my_\nchile, I'm goin' to take _my_ fist (Rolls up right sleeve and gestures\nwith right fist) and knock they teeth down they throat. (She looks\nferocious) 'Case y'all know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till\nI let her go up north last year wid them white folks. I'd ruther her\nto be in de white folks' kitchen than walkin' de streets like some of\ndese girls round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can't\nhelp it if all dese mens get stuck on her.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You'se tellin' de truth, Sister Blunt. That's whut I\nalways say: Don't confidence dese niggers. Do, they'll sho put you in\nde street.\n\nMRS. THOMAS: Naw indeed, never syndicate wid niggers. Do, they will\ndistriminate you. They'll be an _anybody_. You goin' to de trial,\nain't you?\n\nMRS. BLUNT: Just as sho as you snore. An' they better leave Daisy's\nname outa dis, too. I done told her and told her to come straight home\nfrom her work. Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums\nback wid dem trashy niggers. She better not leave them white folks\ntoday to come traipsin' over here scornin' her name all up wid dis\nnigger mess. Do, I'll kill her. No daughter of mine ain't goin' to do\nas she please, long as she live under de sound of my voice. (She\ncrosses to right.)\n\nMRS. THOMAS: That's right, Sister Blunt. I glory in yo' spunk. Lord, I\nbetter go put on my supper.\n\n(As MRS. BLUNT exits, right, REV. CHILDERS enters left with DAVE and\nDEACON LINDSAY and SISTER LEWIS. Very hostile glances from SISTERS\nTHOMAS and TAYLOR toward the others.)\n\nCHILDERS: Good evenin', folks.\n\n(SISTERS THOMAS and TAYLOR just grunt. MRS. THOMAS moves a step or two\ntowards exit. Flirts her skirts and exits.)\n\nLINDSAY: (Angrily) Whut's de matter, y'all? Cat got yo' tongue?\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: More matter than you kin scatter all over Cincinnatti.\n\nLINDSAY: Go 'head on, Lucy Taylor. Go 'head on. You know a very little\nof yo' sugar sweetens my coffee. Go 'head on. Everytime you lift yo'\narm you smell like a nest of yellow hammers.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: Go 'head on yo'self. Yo' head look like it done wore out\nthree bodies. Talkin' 'bout _me_ smellin'--you smell lak a nest of\ngrand daddies yo'self.\n\nLINDSAY: Aw rock on down de road, 'oman. Ah, don't wantuh change words\nwid yuh. Youse too ugly.\n\nMRS. TAYLOR: You ain't nobody's pretty baby, yo'self. You so ugly I\nbetcha yo' wife have to spread uh sheet over yo' head tuh let sleep\nslip up on yuh.\n\nLINDSAY: (Threatening) You better git way from me while you able.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nQuestion:\nWho represents Jim in the trial?\n\nAnswer:\n",

For, within its death-filled chambers--was the avenue of\n    life!_\n\n\nDERELICT\n\nBy Alan E. Nourse\n\nIllustrated by Ed Emsh\n\n\nJohn Sabo, second in command, sat bolt upright in his bunk, blinking\nwide-eyed at the darkness. The alarm was screaming through the Satellite\nStation, its harsh, nerve-jarring clang echoing and re-echoing down the\nmetal corridors, penetrating every nook and crevice and cubicle of the\nlonely outpost, screaming incredibly through the dark sleeping period.\nSabo shook the sleep from his eyes, and then a panic of fear burst into\nhis mind. The alarm! Tumbling out of his bunk in the darkness, he\ncrashed into the far bulkhead, staggering giddily in the impossible\ngravity as he pawed about for his magnaboots, his heart pounding\nfiercely in his ears. The _alarm_! Impossible, after so long, after\nthese long months of bitter waiting-- In the corridor he collided with\nBrownie, looking like a frightened gnome, and he growled profanity as he\nraced down the corridor for the Central Control.\n\nFrightened eyes turned to him as he blinked at the bright lights of the\nroom. The voices rose in a confused, anxious babble, and he shook his\nhead and swore, and ploughed through them toward the screen. \"Kill that\ndamned alarm!\" he roared, blinking as he counted faces. \"Somebody get\nthe Skipper out of his sack, pronto, and stop that clatter! What's the\ntrouble?\"\n\nThe radioman waved feebly at the view screen, shimmering on the great\nside panel. \"We just picked it up--\"\n\nIt was a ship, moving in from beyond Saturn's rings, a huge, gray-black\nblob in the silvery screen, moving in toward the Station with ponderous,\nclumsy grace, growing larger by the second as it sped toward them. Sabo\nfelt the fear spill over in his mind, driving out all thought, and he\nsank into the control chair like a well-trained automaton. His gray eyes\nwere wide, trained for long military years to miss nothing; his fingers\nmoved over the panel with deft skill. \"Get the men to stations,\" he\ngrowled, \"and will somebody kindly get the Skipper down here, if he can\nmanage to take a minute.\"\n\n\"I'm right here.\" The little graying man was at his elbow, staring at\nthe screen with angry red eyes. \"Who told you to shut off the alarm?\"\n\n\"Nobody told me. Everyone was here, and it was getting on my nerves.\"\n\n\"What a shame.\" Captain Loomis' voice was icy. \"I give orders on this\nStation,\" he said smoothly, \"and you'll remember it.\" He scowled at the\ngreat gray ship, looming closer and closer. \"What's its course?\"\n\n\"Going to miss us by several thousand kilos at least. Look at that\nthing! It's _traveling_.\"\n\n\"Contact it! This is what we've been waiting for.\" The captain's voice\nwas hoarse.\n\nSabo spun a dial, and cursed. \"No luck. Can't get through. It's passing\nus--\"\n\n\"Then _grapple_ it, stupid! You want me to wipe your nose, too?\"\n\nSabo's face darkened angrily. With slow precision he set the servo fixes\non the huge gray hulk looming up in the viewer, and then snapped the\nswitches sharply. Two small servos shoved their blunt noses from the\nlanding port of the Station, and slipped silently into space alongside.\nThen, like a pair of trained dogs, they sped on their beams straight out\nfrom the Station toward the approaching ship. The intruder was dark,\nmoving at tremendous velocity past the Station, as though unaware of its\nexistence. The servos moved out, and suddenly diverged and reversed,\ntwisting in long arcs to come alongside the strange ship, finally moving\nin at the same velocity on either side. There was a sharp flash of\ncontact power; then, like a mammoth slow-motion monster, the ship jerked\nin midspace and turned a graceful end-for-end arc as the servo-grapplers\ngripped it like leeches and whined, glowing ruddy with the jolting power\nflowing through them. Sabo watched, hardly breathing, until the great\nship spun and slowed and stopped. Then it reversed direction, and the\nservos led it triumphantly back toward the landing port of the Station.\n\nSabo glanced at the radioman, a frown creasing his forehead. \"Still\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Not a peep.\"\n\nHe stared out at the great ship, feeling a chill of wonder and fear\ncrawl up his spine. \"So this is the mysterious puzzle of Saturn,\" he\nmuttered. \"This is what we've been waiting for.\"\n\nThere was a curious eager light in Captain Loomis' eyes as he looked up.\n\"Oh, no. Not this.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Not this. The ships we've seen before were tiny, flat.\" His little eyes\nturned toward the ship, and back to Sabo's heavy face. \"This is\nsomething else, something quite different.\" A smile curved his lips, and\nhe rubbed his hands together. \"We go out for trout and come back with a\nwhale. This ship's from space, deep space. Not from Saturn. This one's\nfrom the stars.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe strange ship hung at the side of the Satellite Station, silent as a\ntomb, still gently rotating as the Station slowly spun in its orbit\naround Saturn.\n\nIn the captain's cabin the men shifted restlessly, uneasily facing the\neager eyes of their captain. The old man paced the floor of the cabin,\nhis white hair mussed, his face red with excitement. Even his carefully\ncalm face couldn't conceal the eagerness burning in his eyes as he faced\nthe crew. \"Still no contact?\" he asked Sparks.\n\nThe radioman shook his head anxiously. \"Not a sign. I've tried every\nsignal I know at every wave frequency that could possibly reach them.\nI've even tried a dozen frequencies that couldn't possibly reach them,\nand I haven't stirred them up a bit. They just aren't answering.\"\n\nCaptain Loomis swung on the group of men. \"All right, now, I want you to\nget this straight. This is our catch. We don't know what's aboard it,\nand we don't know where it came from, but it's our prize. That means not\na word goes back home about it until we've learned all there is to\nlearn. We're going to get the honors on this one, not some eager Admiral\nback home--\"\n\nThe men stirred uneasily, worried eyes seeking Sabo's face in alarm.\n\"What about the law?\" growled Sabo. \"The law says everything must be\nreported within two hours.\"\n\n\"Then we'll break the law,\" the captain snapped. \"I'm captain of this\nStation, and those are your orders. You don't need to worry about the\nlaw--I'll see that you're protected, but this is too big to fumble. This\nship is from the stars. That means it must have an Interstellar drive.\nYou know what that means. The Government will fall all over itself to\nreward us--\"\n\nSabo scowled, and the worry deepened in the men's faces. It was hard to\nimagine the Government falling all over itself for anybody. They knew\ntoo well how the Government worked. They had heard of the swift trials,\nthe harsh imprisonments that awaited even the petty infringers. The\nMilitary Government had no time to waste on those who stepped out of\nline, they had no mercy to spare. And the men knew that their captain\nwas not in favor in top Government circles. Crack patrol commanders were\nnot shunted into remote, lifeless Satellite Stations if their stand in\nthe Government was high. And deep in their minds, somehow, the men knew\nthey couldn't trust this little, sharp-eyed, white-haired man. The\ncredit for such a discovery as this might go to him, yes--but there\nwould be little left for them.\n\n\"The law--\" Sabo repeated stubbornly.\n\n\"Damn the law! We're stationed out here in this limbo to watch Saturn\nand report any activity we see coming from there. There's nothing in our\norders about anything else. There have been ships from there, they\nthink, but not this ship. The Government has spent billions trying to\nfind an Interstellar, and never gotten to first base.\" The captain\npaused, his eyes narrowing. \"We'll go aboard this ship,\" he said softly.\n\"We'll find out what's aboard it, and where it's from, and we'll take\nits drive. There's been no resistance yet, but it could be dangerous. We\ncan't assume anything. The boarding party will report everything they\nfind to me. One of them will have to be a drive man. That's you,\nBrownie.\"\n\nThe little man with the sharp black eyes looked up eagerly. \"I don't\nknow if I could tell anything--\"\n\n\"You can tell more than anyone else here. Nobody else knows space drive.\nI'll count on you. If you bring back a good report, perhaps we can\ncancel out certain--unfortunate items in your record. But one other\nshould board with you--\" His eyes turned toward John Sabo.\n\n\"Not me. This is your goat.\" The mate's eyes were sullen. \"This is gross\nbreach, and you know it. They'll have you in irons when we get back. I\ndon't want anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"You're under orders, Sabo. You keep forgetting.\"\n\n\"They're illegal orders, sir!\"\n\n\"I'll take responsibility for that.\"\n\nSabo looked the old man straight in the eye. \"You mean you'd sell us\ndown a rat hole to save your skin. That's what you mean.\"\n\nCaptain Loomis' eyes widened incredulously. Then his face darkened, and\nhe stepped very close to the big man. \"You'll watch your tongue, I\nthink,\" he gritted. \"Be careful what you say to me, Sabo. Be very\ncareful. Because if you don't, _you'll_ be in irons, and we'll see just\nhow long you last when you get back home. Now you've got your orders.\nYou'll board the ship with Brownie.\"\n\nThe big man's fists were clenched until the knuckles were white. \"You\ndon't know what's over there!\" he burst out. \"We could be slaughtered.\"\n\nThe captain's smile was unpleasant. \"That would be such a pity,\" he\nmurmured. \"I'd really hate to see it happen--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship hung dark and silent, like a shadowy ghost. No flicker of light\ncould be seen aboard it; no sound nor faintest sign of life came from\nthe tall, dark hull plates. It hung there, huge and imponderable, and\nswung around with the Station in its silent orbit.\n\nThe men huddled about Sabo and Brownie, helping them into their pressure\nsuits, checking their equipment. They had watched the little scanning\nbeetles crawl over the surface of the great ship, examining, probing\nevery nook and crevice, reporting crystals, and metals, and irons, while\nthe boarding party prepared. And still the radioman waited alertly for a\nflicker of life from the solemn giant.\n\nFrightened as they were of their part in the illegal secrecy, the\narrival of the ship had brought a change in the crew, lighting fires of\nexcitement in their eyes. They moved faster, their voices were lighter,\nmore cheerful. Long months on the Station had worn on their nerves--out\nof contact with their homes, on a mission that was secretly jeered as\nutter Governmental folly. Ships _had_ been seen, years before,\ndisappearing into the sullen bright atmospheric crust of Saturn, but\nthere had been no sign of anything since. And out there, on the lonely\nguard Station, nerves had run ragged, always waiting, always watching,\nwearing away even the iron discipline of their military background. They\ngrew bitterly weary of the same faces, the same routine, the constant\nrepetition of inactivity. And through the months they had watched with\nincreasing anxiety the conflict growing between the captain and his\nbitter, sullen-eyed second-in-command, John Sabo.\n\nAnd then the ship had come, incredibly, from the depths of space, and\nthe tensions of loneliness were forgotten in the flurry of activity. The\nlocks whined and opened as the two men moved out of the Station on the\nlittle propulsion sleds, linked to the Station with light silk guy\nropes. Sabo settled himself on the sled, cursing himself for falling so\nfoolishly into the captain's scheme, cursing his tongue for wandering.\nAnd deep within him he felt a new sensation, a vague uneasiness and\ninsecurity that he had not felt in all his years of military life. The\nstrange ship was a variant, an imponderable factor thrown suddenly into\nhis small world of hatred and bitterness, forcing him into unknown\nterritory, throwing his mind into a welter of doubts and fears. He\nglanced uneasily across at Brownie, vaguely wishing that someone else\nwere with him. Brownie was a troublemaker, Brownie talked too much,\nBrownie philosophized in a world that ridiculed philosophy. He'd known\nmen like Brownie before, and he knew that they couldn't be trusted.\n\nThe gray hull gleamed at them as they moved toward it, a monstrous wall\nof polished metal. There were no dents, no surface scars from its\npassage through space. They found the entrance lock without difficulty,\nnear the top of the ship's great hull, and Brownie probed the rim of the\nlock with a dozen instruments, his dark eyes burning eagerly. And then,\nwith a squeal that grated in Sabo's ears, the oval port of the ship\nquivered, and slowly opened.\n\nSilently, the sleds moved into the opening. They were in a small vault,\nquite dark, and the sleds settled slowly onto a metal deck. Sabo eased\nhimself from the seat, tuning up his audios to their highest\nsensitivity, moving over to Brownie. Momentarily they touched helmets,\nand Brownie's excited voice came to him, muted, but breathless. \"No\ntrouble getting it open. It worked on the same principle as ours.\"\n\n\"Better get to work on the inner lock.\"\n\nBrownie shot him a sharp glance. \"But what about--inside? I mean, we\ncan't just walk in on them--\"\n\n\"Why not? We've tried to contact them.\"\n\nReluctantly, the little engineer began probing the inner lock with\ntrembling fingers. Minutes later they were easing themselves through,\nmoving slowly down the dark corridor, waiting with pounding hearts for\na sound, a sign. The corridor joined another, and then still another,\nuntil they reached a great oval door. And then they were inside, in the\nheart of the ship, and their eyes widened as they stared at the thing in\nthe center of the great vaulted chamber.\n\n\"My God!\" Brownie's voice was a hoarse whisper in the stillness. \"Look\nat them, Johnny!\"\n\nSabo moved slowly across the room toward the frail, crushed form lying\nagainst the great, gleaming panel. Thin, almost boneless arms were\npasted against the hard metal; an oval, humanoid skull was crushed like\nan eggshell into the knobs and levers of the control panel. Sudden\nhorror shot through the big man as he looked around. At the far side of\nthe room was another of the things, and still another, mashed, like\nlifeless jelly, into the floors and panels. Gently he peeled a bit of\njelly away from the metal, then turned with a mixture of wonder and\ndisgust. \"All dead,\" he muttered.\n\nBrownie looked up at him, his hands trembling. \"No wonder there was no\nsign.\" He looked about helplessly. \"It's a derelict, Johnny. A wanderer.\nHow could it have happened? How long ago?\"\n\nSabo shook his head, bewildered. \"Then it was just chance that it came\nto us, that we saw it--\"\n\n\"No pilot, no charts. It might have wandered for centuries.\" Brownie\nstared about the room, a frightened look on his face. And then he was\nleaning over the control panel, probing at the array of levers, his\nfingers working eagerly at the wiring. Sabo nodded approvingly. \"We'll\nhave to go over it with a comb,\" he said. \"I'll see what I can find in\nthe rest of the ship. You go ahead on the controls and drive.\" Without\nwaiting for an answer he moved swiftly from the round chamber, out into\nthe corridor again, his stomach almost sick.\n\nIt took them many hours. They moved silently, as if even a slight sound\nmight disturb the sleeping alien forms, smashed against the dark metal\npanels. In another room were the charts, great, beautiful charts,\ntotally unfamiliar, studded with star formations he had never seen,\nnoted with curious, meaningless symbols. As Sabo worked he heard Brownie\nmoving down into the depths of the ship, toward the giant engine rooms.\nAnd then, some silent alarm clicked into place in Sabo's mind,\ntightening his stomach, screaming to be heard. Heart pounding, he dashed\ndown the corridor like a cat, seeing again in his mind the bright, eager\neyes of the engineer. Suddenly the meaning of that eagerness dawned on\nhim. He scampered down a ladder, along a corridor, and down another\nladder, down to the engine room, almost colliding with Brownie as he\ncrossed from one of the engines to a battery of generators on the far\nside of the room.\n\n\"Brownie!\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\nSabo trembled, then turned away. \"Nothing,\" he muttered. \"Just a\nthought.\" But he watched as the little man snaked into the labyrinth of\ndynamos and coils and wires, peering eagerly, probing, searching, making\nnotes in the little pad in his hand.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFinally, hours later, they moved again toward the lock where they had\nleft their sleds. Not a word passed between them. The uneasiness was\nstrong in Sabo's mind now, growing deeper, mingling with fear and a\npremonition of impending evil. A dead ship, a derelict, come to them by\nmerest chance from some unthinkably remote star. He cursed, without\nknowing why, and suddenly he felt he hated Brownie as much as he hated\nthe captain waiting for them in the Station.\n\nBut as he stepped into the Station's lock, a new thought crossed his\nmind, almost dazzling him with its unexpectedness. He looked at the\nengineer's thin face, and his hands were trembling as he opened the\npressure suit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe deliberately took longer than was necessary to give his report to the\ncaptain, dwelling on unimportant details, watching with malicious\namusement the captain's growing annoyance. Captain Loomis' eyes kept\nsliding to Brownie, as though trying to read the information he wanted\nfrom the engineer's face. Sabo rolled up the charts slowly, stowing them\nin a pile on the desk. \"That's the picture, sir. Perhaps a qualified\nastronomer could make something of it; I haven't the knowledge or the\ninstruments. The ship came from outside the system, beyond doubt.\nProbably from a planet with lighter gravity than our own, judging from\nthe frailty of the creatures. Oxygen breathers, from the looks of their\ngas storage. If you ask me, I'd say--\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" the captain breathed impatiently. \"You can write\nit up and hand it to me. It isn't really important where they came from,\nor whether they breathe oxygen or fluorine.\" He turned his eyes to the\nengineer, and lit a cigar with trembling fingers. \"The important thing\nis _how_ they got here. The drive, Brownie. You went over the engines\ncarefully? What did you find?\"\n\nBrownie twitched uneasily, and looked at the floor. \"Oh, yes, I examined\nthem carefully. Wasn't too hard. I examined every piece of drive\nmachinery on the ship, from stem to stern.\"\n\nSabo nodded, slowly, watching the little man with a carefully blank\nface. \"That's right. You gave it a good going over.\"\n\nBrownie licked his lips. \"It's a derelict, like Johnny told you. They\nwere dead. All of them. Probably had been dead for a long time. I\ncouldn't tell, of course. Probably nobody could tell. But they must have\nbeen dead for centuries--\"\n\nThe captain's eyes blinked as the implication sank in. \"Wait a minute,\"\nhe said. \"What do you mean, _centuries_?\"\n\nBrownie stared at his shoes. \"The atomic piles were almost dead,\" he\nmuttered in an apologetic whine. \"The ship wasn't going any place,\ncaptain. It was just wandering. Maybe it's wandered for thousands of\nyears.\" He took a deep breath, and his eyes met the captain's for a\nbrief agonized moment. \"They don't have Interstellar, sir. Just plain,\nsimple, slow atomics. Nothing different. They've been traveling for\ncenturies, and it would have taken them just as long to get back.\"\n\nThe captain's voice was thin, choked. \"Are you trying to tell me that\ntheir drive is no different from our own? That a ship has actually\nwandered into Interstellar space _without a space drive_?\"\n\nBrownie spread his hands helplessly. \"Something must have gone wrong.\nThey must have started off for another planet in their own system, and\nsomething went wrong. They broke into space, and they all died. And the\nship just went on moving. They never intended an Interstellar hop. They\ncouldn't have. They didn't have the drive for it.\"\n\nThe captain sat back numbly, his face pasty gray. The light had faded in\nhis eyes now; he sat as though he'd been struck. \"You--you couldn't be\nwrong? You couldn't have missed anything?\"\n\nBrownie's eyes shifted unhappily, and his voice was very faint. \"No,\nsir.\"\n\nThe captain stared at them for a long moment, like a stricken child.\nSlowly he picked up one of the charts, his mouth working. Then, with a\nbitter roar, he threw it in Sabo's face. \"Get out of here! Take this\ngarbage and get out! And get the men to their stations. We're here to\nwatch Saturn, and by god, we'll watch Saturn!\" He turned away, a hand\nover his eyes, and they heard his choking breath as they left the\ncabin.\n\nSlowly, Brownie walked out into the corridor, started down toward his\ncabin, with Sabo silent at his heels. He looked up once at the mate's\nheavy face, a look of pleading in his dark brown eyes, and then opened\nthe door to his quarters. Like a cat, Sabo was in the room before him,\ndragging him in, slamming the door. He caught the little man by the neck\nwith one savage hand, and shoved him unceremoniously against the door,\nhis voice a vicious whisper. \"_All right, talk! Let's have it now!_\"\n\nBrownie choked, his eyes bulging, his face turning gray in the dim light\nof the cabin. \"Johnny! Let me down! What's the matter? You're choking\nme, Johnny--\"\n\nThe mate's eyes were red, with heavy lines of disgust and bitterness\nrunning from his eyes and the corners of his mouth. \"You stinking little\nliar! _Talk_, damn it! You're not messing with the captain now, you're\nmessing with _me_, and I'll have the truth if I have to cave in your\nskull--\"\n\n\"I told you the truth! I don't know what you mean--\"\n\nSabo's palm smashed into his face, jerking his head about like an apple\non a string. \"That's the wrong answer,\" he grated. \"I warn you, don't\nlie! The captain is an ambitious ass, he couldn't think his way through\na multiplication table. He's a little child. But I'm not quite so dull.\"\nHe threw the little man down in a heap, his eyes blazing. \"You silly\nfool, your story is so full of holes you could drive a tank through it.\nThey just up and died, did they? I'm supposed to believe that? Smashed\nup against the panels the way they were? Only one thing could crush them\nlike that. Any fool could see it. Acceleration. And I don't mean atomic\nacceleration. Something else.\" He glared down at the man quivering on\nthe floor. \"They had Interstellar drive, didn't they, Brownie?\"\n\nBrownie nodded his head, weakly, almost sobbing, trying to pull himself\nerect. \"Don't tell the captain,\" he sobbed. \"Oh, Johnny, for god's sake,\nlisten to me, don't let him know I lied. I was going to tell you anyway,\nJohnny, really I was. I've got a plan, a good plan, can't you see it?\"\nThe gleam of excitement came back into the sharp little eyes. \"They had\nit, all right. Their trip probably took just a few months. They had a\ndrive I've never seen before, non-atomic. I couldn't tell the principle,\nwith the look I had, but I think I could work it.\" He sat up, his whole\nbody trembling. \"Don't give me away, Johnny, listen a minute--\"\n\nSabo sat back against the bunk, staring at the little man. \"You're out\nof your mind,\" he said softly. \"You don't know what you're doing. What\nare you going to do when His Nibs goes over for a look himself? He's\nstupid, but not that stupid.\"\n\nBrownie's voice choked, his words tumbling over each other in his\neagerness. \"He won't get a chance to see it, Johnny. He's got to take\nour word until he sees it, and we can stall him--\"\n\nSabo blinked. \"A day or so--maybe. But what then? Oh, how could you be\nso stupid? He's on the skids, he's out of favor and fighting for his\nlife. That drive is the break that could put him on top. Can't you see\nhe's selfish? He has to be, in this world, to get anything. Anything or\nanyone who blocks him, he'll destroy, if he can. Can't you see that?\nWhen he spots this, your life won't be worth spitting at.\"\n\nBrownie was trembling as he sat down opposite the big man. His voice was\nharsh in the little cubicle, heavy with pain and hopelessness. \"That's\nright,\" he said. \"My life isn't worth a nickle. Neither is yours.\nNeither is anybody's, here or back home. Nobody's life is worth a\nnickle. Something's happened to us in the past hundred years,\nJohnny--something horrible. I've seen it creeping and growing up around\nus all my life. People don't matter any more, it's the Government, what\nthe Government thinks that matters. It's a web, a cancer that grows in\nits own pattern, until it goes so far it can't be stopped. Men like\nLoomis could see the pattern, and adapt to it, throw away all the\nworthwhile things, the love and beauty and peace that we once had in our\nlives. Those men can get somewhere, they can turn this life into a\nclimbing game, waiting their chance to get a little farther toward the\ntop, a little closer to some semblance of security--\"\n\n\"Everybody adapts to it,\" Sabo snapped. \"They have to. You don't see me\nmoving for anyone else, do you? I'm for _me_, and believe me I know it.\nI don't give a hang for you, or Loomis, or anyone else alive--just me. I\nwant to stay alive, that's all. You're a dreamer, Brownie. But until you\npull something like this, you can learn to stop dreaming if you want\nto--\"\n\n\"No, no, you're wrong--oh, you're horribly wrong, Johnny. Some of us\n_can't_ adapt, we haven't got what it takes, or else we have something\nelse in us that won't let us go along. And right there we're beat before\nwe start. There's no place for us now, and there never will be.\" He\nlooked up at the mate's impassive face. \"We're in a life where we don't\nbelong, impounded into a senseless, never-ending series of fights and\nskirmishes and long, lonely waits, feeding this insane urge of the\nGovernment to expand, out to the planets, to the stars, farther and\nfarther, bigger and bigger. We've got to go, seeking newer and greater\nworlds to conquer, with nothing to conquer them with, and nothing to\nconquer them for. There's life somewhere else in our solar system, so it\nmust be sought out and conquered, no matter what or where it is. We live\nin a world of iron and fear, and there was no place for me, and others\nlike me, _until this ship came_--\"\n\nSabo looked at him strangely. \"So I was right. I read it on your face\nwhen we were searching the ship. I knew what you were thinking....\" His\nface darkened angrily. \"You couldn't get away with it, Brownie. Where\ncould you go, what could you expect to find? You're talking death,\nBrownie. Nothing else--\"\n\n\"No, no. Listen, Johnny.\" Brownie leaned closer, his eyes bright and\nintent on the man's heavy face. \"The captain has to take our word for\nit, until he sees the ship. Even then he couldn't tell for sure--I'm\nthe only drive engineer on the Station. We have the charts, we could\nwork with them, try to find out where the ship came from; I already have\nan idea of how the drive is operated. Another look and I could make it\nwork. Think of it, Johnny! What difference does it make where we went,\nor what we found? You're a misfit, too, you know that--this coarseness\nand bitterness is a shell, if you could only see it, a sham. You don't\nreally believe in this world we're in--who cares where, if only we could\ngo, get away? Oh, it's a chance, the wildest, freak chance, but we could\ntake it--\"\n\n\"If only to get away from _him_,\" said Sabo in a muted voice. \"Lord, how\nI hate him. I've seen smallness and ambition before--pettiness and\ntreachery, plenty of it. But that man is our whole world knotted up in\none little ball. I don't think I'd get home without killing him, just to\nstop that voice from talking, just to see fear cross his face one time.\nBut if we took the ship, it would break him for good.\" A new light\nappeared in the big man's eyes. \"He'd be through, Brownie. Washed up.\"\n\n\"And we'd be _free_--\"\n\nSabo's eyes were sharp. \"What about the acceleration? It killed those\nthat came in the ship.\"\n\n\"But they were so frail, so weak. Light brittle bones and soft jelly.\nOur bodies are stronger, we could stand it.\"\n\nSabo sat for a long time, staring at Brownie. His mind was suddenly\nconfused by the scope of the idea, racing in myriad twirling fantasies,\nparading before his eyes the long, bitter, frustrating years, the\nhopelessness of his own life, the dull aching feeling he felt deep in\nhis stomach and bones each time he set back down on Earth, to join the\nteeming throngs of hungry people. He thought of the rows of drab\napartments, the thin faces, the hollow, hunted eyes of the people he had\nseen. He knew that that was why he was a soldier--because soldiers ate\nwell, they had time to sleep, they were never allowed long hours to\nthink, and wonder, and grow dull and empty. But he knew his life had\nbeen barren. The life of a mindless automaton, moving from place to\nplace, never thinking, never daring to think or speak, hoping only to\nwork without pain each day, and sleep without nightmares.\n\nAnd then, he thought of the nights in his childhood, when he had lain\nawake, sweating with fear, as the airships screamed across the dark sky\nabove, bound he never knew where; and then, hearing in the far distance\nthe booming explosion, he had played that horrible little game with\nhimself, seeing how high he could count before he heard the weary,\nplodding footsteps of the people on the road, moving on to another\nplace. He had known, even as a little boy, that the only safe place was\nin those bombers, that the place for survival was in the striking\narmies, and his life had followed the hard-learned pattern, twisting him\ninto the cynical mold of the mercenary soldier, dulling the quick and\nclever mind, drilling into him the ways and responses of order and obey,\nstripping him of his heritage of love and humanity. Others less\nthoughtful had been happier; they had succeeded in forgetting the life\nthey had known before, they had been able to learn easily and well the\nlessons of the repudiation of the rights of men which had crept like a\nblight through the world. But Sabo, too, was a misfit, wrenched into a\nmold he could not fit. He had sensed it vaguely, never really knowing\nwhen or how he had built the shell of toughness and cynicism, but also\nsensing vaguely that it was built, and that in it he could hide,\nsomehow, and laugh at himself, and his leaders, and the whole world\nthrough which he plodded. He had laughed, but there had been long\nnights, in the narrow darkness of spaceship bunks, when his mind pounded\nat the shell, screaming out in nightmare, and he had wondered if he had\nreally lost his mind.\n\nHis gray eyes narrowed as he looked at Brownie, and he felt his heart\npounding in his chest, pounding with a fury that he could no longer\ndeny. \"It would have to be fast,\" he said softly. \"Like lightning,\ntonight, tomorrow--very soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know that. But we _can_ do it--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sabo, with a hard, bitter glint in his eyes. \"Maybe we can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe preparation was tense. For the first time in his life, Sabo knew the\nmeaning of real fear, felt the clinging aura of sudden death in every\nglance, every word of the men around him. It seemed incredible that the\ncaptain didn't notice the brief exchanges with the little engineer, or\nhis own sudden appearances and disappearances about the Station. But the\ncaptain sat in his cabin with angry eyes, snapping answers without even\nlooking up. Still, Sabo knew that the seeds of suspicion lay planted in\nhis mind, ready to burst forth with awful violence at any slight\nprovocation. As he worked, the escape assumed greater and greater\nproportions in Sabo's mind; he knew with increasing urgency and daring\nthat nothing must stop him. The ship was there, the only bridge away\nfrom a life he could no longer endure, and his determination blinded him\nto caution.\n\nPrimarily, he pondered over the charts, while Brownie, growing hourly\nmore nervous, poured his heart into a study of his notes and sketches. A\nsecond look at the engines was essential; the excuse he concocted for\nreturning to the ship was recklessly slender, and Sabo spent a grueling\nfive minutes dissuading the captain from accompanying him. But the\ncaptain's eyes were dull, and he walked his cabin, sunk in a gloomy,\nremorseful trance.\n\nThe hours passed, and the men saw, in despair, that more precious,\ndangerous hours would be necessary before the flight could be attempted.\nAnd then, abruptly, Sabo got the call to the captain's cabin. He found\nthe old man at his desk, regarding him with cold eyes, and his heart\nsank. The captain motioned him to a seat, and then sat back, lighting a\ncigar with painful slowness. \"I want you to tell me,\" he said in a\nlifeless voice, \"exactly what Brownie thinks he's doing.\"\n\nSabo went cold. Carefully he kept his eyes on the captain's face. \"I\nguess he's nervous,\" he said. \"He doesn't belong on a Satellite Station.\nHe belongs at home. The place gets on his nerves.\"\n\n\"I didn't like his report.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Sabo.\n\nThe captain's eyes narrowed. \"It was hard to believe. Ships don't just\nhappen out of space. They don't wander out interstellar by accident,\neither.\" An unpleasant smile curled his lips. \"I'm not telling you\nanything new. I wouldn't want to accuse Brownie of lying, of course--or\nyou either. But we'll know soon. A patrol craft will be here from the\nTriton supply base in an hour. I signaled as soon as I had your\nreports.\" The smile broadened maliciously. \"The patrol craft will have\nexperts aboard. Space drive experts. They'll review your report.\"\n\n\"An hour--\"\n\nThe captain smiled. \"That's what I said. In that hour, you could tell me\nthe truth. I'm not a drive man, I'm an administrator, and organizer and\ndirector. You're the technicians. The truth now could save you much\nunhappiness--in the future.\"\n\nSabo stood up heavily. \"You've got your information,\" he said with a\nbitter laugh. \"The patrol craft will confirm it.\"\n\nThe captain's face went a shade grayer. \"All right,\" he said. \"Go ahead,\nlaugh. I told you, anyway.\"\n\nSabo didn't realize how his hands were trembling until he reached the\nend of the corridor. In despair he saw the plan crumbling beneath his\nfeet, and with the despair came the cold undercurrent of fear. The\npatrol would discover them, disclose the hoax. There was no choice\nleft--ready or not, they'd _have_ to leave.\n\nQuickly he turned in to the central control room where Brownie was\nworking. He sat down, repeating the captain's news in a soft voice.\n\n\"An _hour_! But how can we--\"\n\n\"We've _got_ to. We can't quit now, we're dead if we do.\"\n\nBrownie's eyes were wide with fear. \"But can't we stall them, somehow?\nMaybe if we turned on the captain--\"\n\n\"The crew would back him. They wouldn't dare go along with us. We've got\nto run, nothing else.\" He took a deep breath. \"Can you control the\ndrive?\"\n\nBrownie stared at his hands. \"I--I think so. I can only try.\"\n\n\"You've got to. It's now or never. Get down to the lock, and I'll get\nthe charts. Get the sleds ready.\"\n\nHe scooped the charts from his bunk, folded them carefully and bound\nthem swiftly with cord. Then he ran silently down the corridor to the\nlanding port lock. Brownie was already there, in the darkness, closing\nthe last clamps on his pressure suit. Sabo handed him the charts, and\nbegan the laborious task of climbing into his own suit, panting in the\ndarkness.\n\nAnd then the alarm was clanging in his ear, and the lock was flooded\nwith brilliant light. Sabo stopped short, a cry on his lips, staring at\nthe entrance to the control room.\n\nThe captain was grinning, a nasty, evil grin, his eyes hard and\nhumorless as he stood there flanked by three crewmen. His hand gripped\nan ugly power gun tightly. He just stood there, grinning, and his voice\nwas like fire in Sabo's ears. \"Too bad,\" he said softly. \"You almost\nmade it, too. Trouble is, two can't keep a secret. Shame, Johnny, a\nsmart fellow like you. I might have expected as much from Brownie, but I\nthought you had more sense--\"\n\nSomething snapped in Sabo's mind, then. With a roar, he lunged at the\ncaptain's feet, screaming his bitterness and rage and frustration,\ncatching the old man's calves with his powerful shoulders. The captain\ntoppled, and Sabo was fighting for the power gun, straining with all his\nmight to twist the gun from the thin hand, and he heard his voice\nshouting, \"Run! _Go, Brownie, make it go!_\"\n\nThe lock was open, and he saw Brownie's sled nose out into the\nblackness. The captain choked, his face purple. \"Get him! Don't let him\nget away!\"\n\nThe lock clanged, and the screens showed the tiny fragile sled jet out\nfrom the side of the Station, the small huddled figure clinging to it,\nheading straight for the open port of the gray ship. \"Stop him! The\nguns, you fools, the guns!\"\n\nThe alarm still clanged, and the control room was a flurry of activity.\nThree men snapped down behind the tracer-guns, firing without aiming, in\na frenzied attempt to catch the fleeing sled. The sled began\nzig-zagging, twisting wildly as the shells popped on either side of it.\nThe captain twisted away from Sabo's grip with a roar, and threw one of\nthe crewmen to the deck, wrenching the gun controls from his hands. \"Get\nthe big ones on the ship! Blast it! If it gets away you'll all pay.\"\n\nSuddenly the sled popped into the ship's port, and the hatch slowly\nclosed behind it. Raving, the captain turned the gun on the sleek,\npolished hull plates, pressed the firing levels on the war-head servos.\nThree of them shot out from the Satellite, like deadly bugs, careening\nthrough the intervening space, until one of them struck the side of the\ngray ship, and exploded in purple fury against the impervious hull. And\nthe others nosed into the flame, and passed on through, striking\nnothing.\n\nLike the blinking of a light, the alien ship had throbbed, and jerked,\nand was gone.\n\nWith a roar the captain brought his fist down on the hard plastic and\nmetal of the control panel, kicked at the sheet of knobs and levers with\na heavy foot, his face purple with rage. His whole body shook as he\nturned on Sabo, his eyes wild. \"You let him get away! It was your fault,\nyours! But _you_ won't get away! I've got you, and you'll pay, do you\nhear that?\" He pulled himself up until his face was bare inches from\nSabo's, his teeth bared in a frenzy of hatred. \"Now we'll see who'll\nlaugh, my friend. You'll laugh in the death chamber, if you can still\nlaugh by then!\" He turned to the men around him. \"Take him,\" he snarled.\n\"Lock him in his quarters, and guard him well. And while you're doing\nit, take a good look at him. See how he laughs now.\"\n\nThey marched him down to his cabin, stunned, still wondering what had\nhappened. Something had gone in his mind in that second, something that\ntold him that the choice had to be made, instantly. Because he knew,\nwith dull wonder, that in that instant when the lights went on he could\nhave stopped Brownie, could have saved himself. He could have taken for\nhimself a piece of the glory and promotion due to the discoverers of an\nInterstellar drive. But he had also known, somehow, in that short\ninstant, that the only hope in the world lay in that one nervous,\nfrightened man, and the ship which could take him away.\n\nAnd the ship was gone. That meant the captain was through. He'd had his\nchance, the ship's coming had given him his chance, and he had muffed\nit. Now he, too, would pay. The Government would not be pleased that\nsuch a ship had leaked through his fingers. Captain Loomis was through.\n\nAnd him? Somehow, it didn't seem to matter any more. He had made a stab\nat it, he had tried. He just hadn't had the luck. But he knew there was\nmore to that. Something in his mind was singing, some deep feeling of\nhappiness and hope had crept into his mind, and he couldn't worry about\nhimself any more. There was nothing more for him; they had him cold. But\ndeep in his mind he felt a curious satisfaction, transcending any fear\nand bitterness. Deep in his heart, he knew that _one_ man had escaped.\n\nAnd then he sat back and laughed.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _If: Worlds of Science Fiction_ May\n    1953.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow do the men know the spaceship has ended its voyage?\n\nAnswer:\n",

Many were so horribly\nafraid of him that they could not forgive me for not being afraid of\nhim: I seemed to be trifling heartlessly with a deadly peril. I knew\nbetter; and I have represented Caesar as knowing better himself. But\nit was one of the quaintnesses of popular feeling during the war that\nanyone who breathed the slightest doubt of the absolute perfection of\nGerman organization, the Machiavellian depth of German diplomacy, the\nomniscience of German science, the equipment of every German with a\ncomplete philosophy of history, and the consequent hopelessness\nof overcoming so magnificently accomplished an enemy except by the\nsacrifice of every recreative activity to incessant and vehement war\nwork, including a heartbreaking mass of fussing and cadging and bluffing\nthat did nothing but waste our energies and tire our resolution, was\ncalled a pro-German.\n\nNow that this is all over, and the upshot of the fighting has shown that\nwe could quite well have afforded to laugh at the doomed Inca, I am in\nanother difficulty. I may be supposed to be hitting Caesar when he is\ndown. That is why I preface the play with this reminder that when it\nwas written he was not down. To make quite sure, I have gone through the\nproof sheets very carefully, and deleted everything that could possibly\nbe mistaken for a foul blow. I have of course maintained the ancient\nprivilege of comedy to chasten Caesar's foibles by laughing at them,\nwhilst introducing enough obvious and outrageous fiction to relieve both\nmyself and my model from the obligations and responsibilities of sober\nhistory and biography. But I should certainly put the play in the fire\ninstead of publishing it if it contained a word against our defeated\nenemy that I would not have written in 1913.\n\nThe Inca of Perusalem was performed for the first time in England by\nthe Pioneer Players at the Criterion Theatre, London, on 16th December,\n1917, with Gertrude Kingston as Ermyntrude, Helen Morris as the\nPrincess, Nigel Playfair as the waiter, Alfred Drayton as the hotel\nmanager, C. Wordley Hulse as the Archdeacon, and Randle Ayrton as the\nInca.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nThe tableau curtains are closed. An English archdeacon comes through\nthem in a condition of extreme irritation. He speaks through the\ncurtains to someone behind them.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Once for all, Ermyntrude, I cannot afford to maintain\nyou in your present extravagance. [He goes to a flight of steps\nleading to the stalls and sits down disconsolately on the top step. A\nfashionably dressed lady comes through the curtains and contemplates him\nwith patient obstinacy. He continues, grumbling.] An English clergyman's\ndaughter should be able to live quite respectably and comfortably on an\nallowance of \u00a3150 a year, wrung with great difficulty from the domestic\nbudget.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are not a common clergyman: you are an archdeacon.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON [angrily]. That does not affect my emoluments to the\nextent of enabling me to support a daughter whose extravagance would\ndisgrace a royal personage. [Scrambling to his feet and scolding at\nher.] What do you mean by it, Miss?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh really, father! Miss! Is that the way to talk to a widow?\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Is that the way to talk to a father? Your marriage was\na most disastrous imprudence. It gave you habits that are absolutely\nbeyond your means--I mean beyond my means: you have no means. Why did\nyou not marry Matthews: the best curate I ever had?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I wanted to; and you wouldn't let me. You insisted on my\nmarrying Roosenhonkers-Pipstein.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. I had to do the best for you, my child.\nRoosenhonkers-Pipstein was a millionaire.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How did you know he was a millionaire?\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. He came from America. Of course he was a millionaire.\nBesides, he proved to my solicitors that he had fifteen million dollars\nwhen you married him.\n\nERYNTRUDE. His solicitors proved to me that he had sixteen millions when\nhe died. He was a millionaire to the last.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. O Mammon, Mammon! I am punished now for bowing the knee\nto him. Is there nothing left of your settlement? Fifty thousand dollars\na year it secured to you, as we all thought. Only half the securities\ncould be called speculative. The other half were gilt-edged. What has\nbecome of it all?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The speculative ones were not paid up; and the gilt-edged\nones just paid the calls on them until the whole show burst up.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Ermyntrude: what expressions!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh bother! If you had lost ten thousand a year what\nexpressions would you use, do you think? The long and the short of it is\nthat I can't live in the squalid way you are accustomed to.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Squalid!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I have formed habits of comfort.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Comfort!!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, elegance if you like. Luxury, if you insist. Call it\nwhat you please. A house that costs less than a hundred thousand dollars\na year to run is intolerable to me.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. Then, my dear, you had better become lady's maid to a\nprincess until you can find another millionaire to marry you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. That's an idea. I will. [She vanishes through the curtains.]\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON. What! Come back. Come back this instant. [The lights are\nlowered.] Oh, very well: I have nothing more to say. [He descends the\nsteps into the auditorium and makes for the door, grumbling all the\ntime.] Insane, senseless extravagance! [Barking.] Worthlessness!!\n[Muttering.] I will not bear it any longer. Dresses, hats, furs,\ngloves, motor rides: one bill after another: money going like water. No\nrestraint, no self-control, no decency. [Shrieking.] I say, no decency!\n[Muttering again.] Nice state of things we are coming to! A pretty\nworld! But I simply will not bear it. She can do as she likes. I wash\nmy hands of her: I am not going to die in the workhouse for any\ngood-for-nothing, undutiful, spendthrift daughter; and the sooner that\nis understood by everybody the better for all par---- [He is by this\ntime out of hearing in the corridor.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAY\n\nA hotel sitting room. A table in the centre. On it a telephone. Two\nchairs at it, opposite one another. Behind it, the door. The fireplace\nhas a mirror in the mantelpiece.\n\nA spinster Princess, hatted and gloved, is ushered in by the hotel\nmanager, spruce and artifically bland by professional habit, but\ntreating his customer with a condescending affability which sails very\nclose to the east wind of insolence.\n\nTHE MANAGER. I am sorry I am unable to accommodate Your Highness on the\nfirst floor.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [very shy and nervous.] Oh, please don't mention it. This\nis quite nice. Very nice. Thank you very much.\n\nTHE MANAGER. We could prepare a room in the annexe--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no. This will do very well.\n\nShe takes of her gloves and hat: puts them on the table; and sits down.\n\nTHE MANAGER. The rooms are quite as good up here. There is less noise;\nand there is the lift. If Your Highness desires anything, there is the\ntelephone--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you, I don't want anything. The telephone is so\ndifficult: I am not accustomed to it.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Can I take any order? Some tea?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you. Yes: I should like some tea, if I might--if\nit would not be too much trouble.\n\nHe goes out. The telephone rings. The Princess starts out of her chair,\nterrified, and recoils as far as possible from the instrument.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It rings again. She looks scared. It rings\nagain. She approaches it timidly. It rings again. She retreats hastily.\nIt rings repeatedly. She runs to it in desperation and puts the receiver\nto her ear.] Who is there? What do I do? I am not used to the telephone:\nI don't know how--What! Oh, I can hear you speaking quite distinctly.\n[She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How\nwonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please,\nsend her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please\ndon't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What?\nOh yes, it's quite easy. I had no idea--am I to hang it up just as it\nwas? Thank you. [She hangs it up.]\n\nErmyntrude enters, presenting a plain and staid appearance in a long\nstraight waterproof with a hood over her head gear. She comes to the end\nof the table opposite to that at which the Princess is seated.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Excuse me. I have been talking through the telephone: and\nI heard quite well, though I have never ventured before. Won't you sit\ndown?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No, thank you, Your Highness. I am only a lady's maid. I\nunderstood you wanted one.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no: you mustn't think I want one. It's so unpatriotic\nto want anything now, on account of the war, you know. I sent my\nmaid away as a public duty; and now she has married a soldier and is\nexpecting a war baby. But I don't know how to do without her. I've tried\nmy very best; but somehow it doesn't answer: everybody cheats me; and\nin the end it isn't any saving. So I've made up my mind to sell my piano\nand have a maid. That will be a real saving, because I really don't care\na bit for music, though of course one has to pretend to. Don't you think\nso?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Certainly I do, Your Highness. Nothing could be more\ncorrect. Saving and self-denial both at once; and an act of kindness to\nme, as I am out of place.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I'm so glad you see it in that way. Er--you won't mind my\nasking, will you?--how did you lose your place?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The war, Your Highness, the war.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes, of course. But how--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [taking out her handkerchief and showing signs of grief]. My\npoor mistress--\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh please say no more. Don't think about it. So tactless\nof me to mention it.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [mastering her emotion and smiling through her tears]. Your\nHighness is too good.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Do you think you could be happy with me? I attach such\nimportance to that.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [gushing]. Oh, I know--I shall.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. You must not expect too much. There is my uncle. He is\nvery severe and hasty; and he is my guardian. I once had a maid I liked\nvery much; but he sent her away the very first time.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The first time of what, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, something she did. I am sure she had never done it\nbefore; and I know she would never have done it again, she was so truly\ncontrite and nice about it.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. About what, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Well, she wore my jewels and one of my dresses at a rather\nimproper ball with her young man; and my uncle saw her.\n\nERYMNTRUDE. Then he was at the ball too, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [struck by the inference]. I suppose he must have been. I\nwonder! You know, it's very sharp of you to find that out. I hope you\nare not too sharp.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. A lady's maid has to be, Your Highness. [She produces some\nletters.] Your Highness wishes to see my testimonials, no doubt. I have\none from an Archdeacon. [She proffers the letters.]\n\nTHE PRINCESS [taking them]. Do archdeacons have maids? How curious!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No, Your Highness. They have daughters. I have first-rate\ntestimonials from the Archdeacon and from his daughter.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [reading them]. The daughter says you are in every respect\na treasure. The Archdeacon says he would have kept you if he could\npossibly have afforded it. Most satisfactory, I'm sure.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. May I regard myself as engaged then, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [alarmed]. Oh, I'm sure I don't know. If you like, of\ncourse; but do you think I ought to?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Naturally I think Your Highness ought to, most decidedly.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh well, if you think that, I daresay you're quite right.\nYou'll excuse my mentioning it, I hope; but what wages--er--?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The same as the maid who went to the ball. Your Highness\nneed not make any change.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. M'yes. Of course she began with less. But she had such a\nnumber of relatives to keep! It was quite heartbreaking: I had to raise\nher wages again and again.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I shall be quite content with what she began on; and I have\nno relatives dependent on me. And I am willing to wear my own dresses at\nballs.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I am sure nothing could be fairer than that. My uncle\ncan't object to that, can he?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. If he does, Your Highness, ask him to speak to me about\nit. I shall regard it as part of my duties to speak to your uncle about\nmatters of business.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Would you? You must be frightfully courageous.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. May I regard myself as engaged, Your Highness? I should like\nto set about my duties immediately.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes, I think so. Oh certainly. I--\n\nA waiter comes in with the tea. He places the tray on the table.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [raising the cover from the tea cake and looking at it]. How\nlong has that been standing at the top of the stairs?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [terrified]. Oh please! It doesn't matter.\n\nTHE WAITER. It has not been waiting. Straight from the kitchen, madam,\nbelieve me.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Send the manager here.\n\nTHE WAITER. The manager! What do you want with the manager?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. He will tell you when I have done with him. How dare you\ntreat Her Highness in this disgraceful manner? What sort of pothouse is\nthis? Where did you learn to speak to persons of quality? Take away your\ncold tea and cold cake instantly. Give them to the chambermaid you were\nflirting with whilst Her Highness was waiting. Order some fresh tea\nat once; and do not presume to bring it yourself: have it brought by a\ncivil waiter who is accustomed to wait on ladies, and not, like you, on\ncommercial travellers.\n\nTHE WAITER. Alas, madam, I am not accustomed to wait on anybody. Two\nyears ago I was an eminent medical man, my waiting-room was crowded with\nthe flower of the aristocracy and the higher bourgeoisie from nine to\nsix every day. But the war came; and my patients were ordered to give\nup their luxuries. They gave up their doctors, but kept their week-end\nhotels, closing every career to me except the career of a waiter.\n[He puts his fingers on the teapot to test its temperature, and\nautomatically takes out his watch with the other hand as if to count the\nteapot's pulse.] You are right: the tea is cold: it was made by the wife\nof a once fashionable architect. The cake is only half toasted: what can\nyou expect from a ruined west-end tailor whose attempt to establish a\nsecond-hand business failed last Tuesday week? Have you the heart to\ncomplain to the manager? Have we not suffered enough? Are our miseries\nnev---- [the manager enters]. Oh Lord! here he is. [The waiter withdraws\nabjectly, taking the tea tray with him.]\n\nTHE MANAGER. Pardon, Your Highness; but I have received an urgent\ninquiry for rooms from an English family of importance; and I venture\nto ask you to let me know how long you intend to honor us with your\npresence.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [rising anxiously]. Oh! am I in the way?\n\nERMYNTRUDE [sternly]. Sit down, madam. [The Princess sits down\nforlornly. Ermyntrude turns imperiously to the Manager.] Her Highness\nwill require this room for twenty minutes.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Twenty minutes!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Yes: it will take fully that time to find a proper apartment\nin a respectable hotel.\n\nTHE MANAGER. I do not understand.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You understand perfectly. How dare you offer Her Highness a\nroom on the second floor?\n\nTHE MANAGER. But I have explained. The first floor is occupied. At\nleast--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well? at least?\n\nTHE MANAGER. It is occupied.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Don't you dare tell Her Highness a falsehood. It is not\noccupied. You are saving it up for the arrival of the five-fifteen\nexpress, from which you hope to pick up some fat armaments contractor\nwho will drink all the bad champagne in your cellar at 5 francs a\nbottle, and pay twice over for everything because he is in the same\nhotel with Her Highness, and can boast of having turned her out of the\nbest rooms.\n\nTHE MANAGER. But Her Highness was so gracious. I did not know that Her\nHighness was at all particular.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. And you take advantage of Her Highness's graciousness. You\nimpose on her with your stories. You give her a room not fit for a dog.\nYou send cold tea to her by a decayed professional person disguised as a\nwaiter. But don't think you can trifle with me. I am a lady's maid; and\nI know the ladies' maids and valets of all the aristocracies of Europe\nand all the millionaires of America. When I expose your hotel as the\nsecond-rate little hole it is, not a soul above the rank of a curate\nwith a large family will be seen entering it. I shake its dust off my\nfeet. Order the luggage to be taken down at once.\n\nTHE MANAGER [appealing to the Princess]. Can Your Highness believe this\nof me? Have I had the misfortune to offend Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh no. I am quite satisfied. Please--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Is Your Highness dissatisfied with me?\n\nTHE PRINCESS [intimidated]. Oh no: please don't think that. I only\nmeant--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [to the manager]. You hear. Perhaps you think Her Highness\nis going to do the work of teaching you your place herself, instead of\nleaving it to her maid.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Oh please, mademoiselle. Believe me: our only wish is to\nmake you perfectly comfortable. But in consequence of the war, all royal\npersonages now practise a rigid economy, and desire us to treat them\nlike their poorest subjects.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh yes. You are quite right--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [interrupting]. There! Her Highness forgives you; but don't\ndo it again. Now go downstairs, my good man, and get that suite on the\nfirst floor ready for us. And send some proper tea. And turn on the\nheating apparatus until the temperature in the rooms is comfortably\nwarm. And have hot water put in all the bedrooms--\n\nTHE MANAGER. There are basins with hot and cold taps.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [scornfully]. Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose we must put up\nwith that: sinks in our rooms, and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle\nall over the house whenever anyone washes his hands. I know.\n\nTHE MANAGER [gallant]. You are hard to please, mademoiselle.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. No harder than other people. But when I'm not pleased I'm\nnot too ladylike to say so. That's all the difference. There is nothing\nmore, thank you.\n\nThe Manager shrugs his shoulders resignedly; makes a deep bow to the\nPrincess; goes to the door; wafts a kiss surreptitiously to Ermyntrude;\nand goes out.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. It's wonderful! How have you the courage?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. In Your Highness's service I know no fear. Your Highness can\nleave all unpleasant people to me.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. How I wish I could! The most dreadful thing of all I have\nto go through myself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Dare I ask what it is, Your Highness?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I'm going to be married. I'm to be met here and married to\na man I never saw. A boy! A boy who never saw me! One of the sons of the\nInca of Perusalem.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Indeed? Which son?\n\nTHE PRINCESS. I don't know. They haven't settled which. It's a dreadful\nthing to be a princess: they just marry you to anyone they like. The\nInca is to come and look at me, and pick out whichever of his sons he\nthinks will suit. And then I shall be an alien enemy everywhere except\nin Perusalem, because the Inca has made war on everybody. And I shall\nhave to pretend that everybody has made war on him. It's too bad.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Still, a husband is a husband. I wish I had one.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, how can you say that! I'm afraid you're not a nice\nwoman.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Your Highness is provided for. I'm not.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Even if you could bear to let a man touch you, you\nshouldn't say so.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I shall not say so again, Your Highness, except perhaps to\nthe man.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. It's too dreadful to think of. I wonder you can be so\ncoarse. I really don't think you'll suit. I feel sure now that you know\nmore about men than you should.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am a widow, Your Highness.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [overwhelmed]. Oh, I BEG your pardon. Of course I ought to\nhave known you would not have spoken like that if you were not married.\nThat makes it all right, doesn't it? I'm so sorry.\n\nThe Manager returns, white, scared, hardly able to speak.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Your Highness, an officer asks to see you on behalf of the\nInca of Perusalem.\n\nTHE PRINCESS [rising distractedly]. Oh, I can't, really. Oh, what shall\nI do?\n\nTHE MANAGER. On important business, he says, Your Highness. Captain\nDuval.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Duval! Nonsense! The usual thing. It is the Inca himself,\nincognito.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, send him away. Oh, I'm so afraid of the Inca. I'm not\nproperly dressed to receive him; and he is so particular: he would order\nme to stay in my room for a week. Tell him to call tomorrow: say I'm ill\nin bed. I can't: I won't: I daren't: you must get rid of him somehow.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Leave him to me, Your Highness.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. You'd never dare!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am an Englishwoman, Your Highness, and perfectly capable\nof tackling ten Incas if necessary. I will arrange the matter. [To the\nManager.] Show Her Highness to her bedroom; and then show Captain Duval\nin here.\n\nTHE PRINCESS. Oh, thank you so much. [She goes to the door. Ermyntrude,\nnoticing that she has left her hat and gloves on the table, runs after\nher with them.] Oh, THANK you. And oh, please, if I must have one of his\nsons, I should like a fair one that doesn't shave, with soft hair and a\nbeard. I couldn't bear being kissed by a bristly person. [She runs out,\nthe Manager bowing as she passes. He follows her.]\n\nErmyntrude whips off her waterproof; hides it; and gets herself swiftly\ninto perfect trim at the mirror, before the Manager, with a large jewel\ncase in his hand, returns, ushering in the Inca.\n\nTHE MANAGER. Captain Duval.\n\nThe Inca, in military uniform, advances with a marked and imposing stage\nwalk; stops; orders the trembling Manager by a gesture to place the\njewel case on the table; dismisses him with a frown; touches his helmet\ngraciously to Ermyntrude; and takes off his cloak.\n\nTHE INCA. I beg you, madam, to be quite at your ease, and to speak to me\nwithout ceremony.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [moving haughtily and carelessly to the table]. I hadn't the\nslightest intention of treating you with ceremony. [She sits down: a\nliberty which gives him a perceptible shock.] I am quite at a loss to\nimagine why I should treat a perfect stranger named Duval: a captain!\nalmost a subaltern! with the smallest ceremony.\n\nTHE INCA. That is true. I had for the moment forgotten my position.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. It doesn't matter. You may sit down.\n\nTHE INCA [frowning.] What!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I said, you...may...sit...down.\n\nTHE INCA. Oh. [His moustache droops. He sits down.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What is your business?\n\nTHE INCA. I come on behalf of the Inca of Perusalem.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The Allerhochst?\n\nTHE INCA. Precisely.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I wonder does he feel ridiculous when people call him the\nAllerhochst.\n\nTHE INCA [surprised]. Why should he? He IS the Allerhochst.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Is he nice looking?\n\nTHE INCA. I--er. Er--I. I--er. I am not a good judge.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. They say he takes himself very seriously.\n\nTHE INCA. Why should he not, madam? Providence has entrusted to his\nfamily the care of a mighty empire. He is in a position of half divine,\nhalf paternal, responsibility towards sixty millions of people, whose\nduty it is to die for him at the word of command. To take himself\notherwise than seriously would be blasphemous. It is a punishable\noffence--severely punishable--in Perusalem. It is called\nIncadisparagement.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How cheerful! Can he laugh?\n\nTHE INCA. Certainly, madam. [He laughs, harshly and mirthlessly.] Ha ha!\nHa ha ha!\n\nERMYNTRUDE [frigidly]. I asked could the Inca laugh. I did not ask could\nyou laugh.\n\nTHE INCA. That is true, madam. [Chuckling.] Devilish amusing, that!\n[He laughs, genially and sincerely, and becomes a much more agreeable\nperson.] Pardon me: I am now laughing because I cannot help it. I am\namused. The other was merely an imitation: a failure, I admit.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You intimated that you had some business?\n\nTHE INCA [producing a very large jewel case, and relapsing into\nsolemnity.] I am instructed by the Allerhochst to take a careful note\nof your features and figure, and, if I consider them satisfactory, to\npresent you with this trifling token of His Imperial Majesty's regard.\nI do consider them satisfactory. Allow me [he opens the jewel case and\npresents it.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [staring at the contents]. What awful taste he must have! I\ncan't wear that.\n\nTHE INCA [reddening]. Take care, madam! This brooch was designed by the\nInca himself. Allow me to explain the design. In the centre, the shield\nof Arminius. The ten surrounding medallions represent the ten castles\nof His Majesty. The rim is a piece of the telephone cable laid by His\nMajesty across the Shipskeel canal. The pin is a model in miniature of\nthe sword of Henry the Birdcatcher.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Miniature! It must be bigger than the original. My good man,\nyou don't expect me to wear this round my neck: it's as big as a turtle.\n[He shuts the case with an angry snap.] How much did it cost?\n\nTHE INCA. For materials and manufacture alone, half a million Perusalem\ndollars, madam. The Inca's design constitutes it a work of art. As such,\nit is now worth probably ten million dollars.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Give it to me [she snatches it]. I'll pawn it and buy\nsomething nice with the money.\n\nTHE INCA. Impossible, madam. A design by the Inca must not be exhibited\nfor sale in the shop window of a pawnbroker. [He flings himself into his\nchair, fuming.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. So much the better. The Inca will have to redeem it to save\nhimself from that disgrace; and the poor pawnbroker will get his money\nback. Nobody would buy it, you know.\n\nTHE INCA. May I ask why?\n\nERMYNTRUDL. Well, look at it! Just look at it! I ask you!\n\nTHE INCA [his moustache drooping ominously]. I am sorry to have to\nreport to the Inca that you have no soul for fine art. [He rises\nsulkily.] The position of daughter-in-law to the Inca is not compatible\nwith the tastes of a pig. [He attempts to take back the brooch.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [rising and retreating behind her chair with the brooch].\nHere! you let that brooch alone. You presented it to me on behalf of the\nInca. It is mine. You said my appearance was satisfactory.\n\nTHE INCA. Your appearance is not satisfactory. The Inca would not allow\nhis son to marry you if the boy were on a desert island and you were the\nonly other human being on it [he strides up the room.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [calmly sitting down and replacing the case on the table].\nHow could he? There would be no clergyman to marry us. It would have to\nbe quite morganatic.\n\nTHE INCA [returning]. Such an expression is out of place in the mouth of\na princess aspiring to the highest destiny on earth. You have the morals\nof a dragoon. [She receives this with a shriek of laughter. He struggles\nwith his sense of humor.] At the same time [he sits down] there is a\ncertain coarse fun in the idea which compels me to smile [he turns up\nhis moustache and smiles.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. When I marry the Inca's son, Captain, I shall make the Inca\norder you to cut off that moustache. It is too irresistible. Doesn't it\nfascinate everyone in Perusalem?\n\nTHE INCA [leaning forward to her energetically]. By all the thunders of\nThor, madam, it fascinates the whole world.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What I like about you, Captain Duval, is your modesty.\n\nTHE INCA [straightening up suddenly]. Woman, do not be a fool.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [indignant]. Well!\n\nTHE INCA. You must look facts in the face. This moustache is an exact\ncopy of the Inca's moustache. Well, does the world occupy itself with\nthe Inca's moustache or does it not? Does it ever occupy itself with\nanything else? If that is the truth, does its recognition constitute\nthe Inca a coxcomb? Other potentates have moustaches: even beards\nand moustaches. Does the world occupy itself with those beards and\nmoustaches? Do the hawkers in the streets of every capital on the\ncivilized globe sell ingenious cardboard representations of their faces\non which, at the pulling of a simple string, the moustaches turn up and\ndown, so--[he makes his moustache turn, up and down several times]? No!\nI say No. The Inca's moustache is so watched and studied that it has\nmade his face the political barometer of the whole continent. When that\nmoustache goes up, culture rises with it. Not what you call culture;\nbut Kultur, a word so much more significant that I hardly understand\nit myself except when I am in specially good form. When it goes down,\nmillions of men perish.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You know, if I had a moustache like that, it would turn my\nhead. I should go mad. Are you quite sure the Inca isn't mad?\n\nTHE INCA. How can he be mad, madam? What is sanity? The condition of the\nInca's mind. What is madness? The condition of the people who disagree\nwith the Inca.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Then I am a lunatic because I don't like that ridiculous\nbrooch.\n\nTHE INCA. No, madam: you are only an idiot.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Thank you.\n\nTHE INCA. Mark you: It is not to be expected that you should see eye to\neye with the Inca. That would be presumption. It is for you to accept\nwithout question or demur the assurance of your Inca that the brooch is\na masterpiece.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. MY Inca! Oh, come! I like that. He is not my Inca yet.\n\nTHE INCA. He is everybody's Inca, madam. His realm will yet extend to\nthe confines of the habitable earth. It is his divine right; and let\nthose who dispute it look to themselves. Properly speaking, all those\nwho are now trying to shake his world predominance are not at war with\nhim, but in rebellion against him.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, he started it, you know.\n\nTHE INCA. Madam, be just. When the hunters surround the lion, the lion\nwill spring. The Inca had kept the peace of years. Those who attacked\nhim were steeped in blood, black blood, white blood, brown blood, yellow\nblood, blue blood. The Inca had never shed a drop.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. He had only talked.\n\nTHE INCA. Only TALKED! ONLY talked! What is more glorious than talk? Can\nanyone in the world talk like him? Madam, when he signed the declaration\nof war, he said to his foolish generals and admirals, 'Gentlemen, you\nwill all be sorry for this.' And they are. They know now that they had\nbetter have relied on the sword of the spirit: in other words, on their\nInca's talk, than on their murderous cannons. The world will one day do\njustice to the Inca as the man who kept the peace with nothing but his\ntongue and his moustache. While he talked: talked just as I am talking\nnow to you, simply, quietly, sensibly, but GREATLY, there was peace;\nthere was prosperity; Perusalem went from success to success. He has\nbeen silenced for a year by the roar of trinitrotoluene and the bluster\nof fools; and the world is in ruins. What a tragedy! [He is convulsed\nwith grief.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Captain Duval, I don't want to be unsympathetic; but suppose\nwe get back to business.\n\nTHE INCA. Business! What business?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, MY business. You want me to marry one of the Inca's\nsons: I forget which.\n\nTHE INCA. As far as I can recollect the name, it is His Imperial\nHighness Prince Eitel William Frederick George Franz Josef Alexander\nNicholas Victor Emmanuel Albert Theodore Wilson--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [interrupting]. Oh, please, please, mayn't I have one with a\nshorter name? What is he called at home?\n\nTHE INCA. He is usually called Sonny, madam. [With great charm of\nmanner.] But you will please understand that the Inca has no desire to\npin you to any particular son. There is Chips and Spots and Lulu and\nPongo and the Corsair and the Piffler and Jack Johnson the Second,\nall unmarried. At least not seriously married: nothing, in short, that\ncannot be arranged. They are all at your service.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Are they all as clever and charming as their father?\n\nTHE INCA [lifts his eyebrows pityingly; shrugs his shoulders; then,\nwith indulgent paternal contempt]. Excellent lads, madam. Very honest\naffectionate creatures. I have nothing against them. Pongo imitates\nfarmyard sounds--cock crowing and that sort of thing--extremely well.\nLulu plays Strauss's Sinfonia Domestica on the mouth organ really\nscreamingly. Chips keeps owls and rabbits. Spots motor bicycles. The\nCorsair commands canal barges and steers them himself. The Piffler\nwrites plays, and paints most abominably. Jack Johnson trims ladies'\nhats, and boxes with professionals hired for that purpose. He is\ninvariably victorious. Yes: they all have their different little\ntalents. And also, of course, their family resemblances. For example,\nthey all smoke; they all quarrel with one another; and they none of them\nappreciate their father, who, by the way, is no mean painter, though the\nPiffler pretends to ridicule his efforts.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Quite a large choice, eh?\n\nTHE INCA. But very little to choose, believe me. I should not recommend\nPongo, because he snores so frightfully that it has been necessary to\nbuild him a sound-proof bedroom: otherwise the royal family would get no\nsleep. But any of the others would suit equally well--if you are really\nbent on marrying one of them.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. If! What is this? I never wanted to marry one of them. I\nthought you wanted me to.\n\nTHE INCA. I did, madam; but [confidentially, flattering her] you are not\nquite the sort of person I expected you to be; and I doubt whether\nany of these young degenerates would make you happy. I trust I am not\nshowing any want of natural feeling when I say that from the point of\nview of a lively, accomplished, and beautiful woman [Ermyntrude bows]\nthey might pall after a time. I suggest that you might prefer the Inca\nhimself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, Captain, how could a humble person like myself be of\nany interest to a prince who is surrounded with the ablest and most\nfar-reaching intellects in the world?\n\nTAE INCA [explosively]. What on earth are you talking about, madam? Can\nyou name a single man in the entourage of the Inca who is not a born\nfool?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, how can you say that! There is Admiral von Cockpits--\n\nTHE INCA [rising intolerantly and striding about the room]. Von\nCockpits! Madam, if Von Cockpits ever goes to heaven, before three weeks\nare over the Angel Gabriel will be at war with the man in the moon.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But General Von Schinkenburg--\n\nTHE INCA. Schinkenburg! I grant you, Schinkenburg has a genius for\ndefending market gardens. Among market gardens he is invincible. But\nwhat is the good of that? The world does not consist of market gardens.\nTurn him loose in pasture and he is lost. The Inca has defeated all\nthese generals again and again at manoeuvres; and yet he has to\ngive place to them in the field because he would be blamed for every\ndisaster--accused of sacrificing the country to his vanity. Vanity! Why\ndo they call him vain? Just because he is one of the few men who are not\nafraid to live. Why do they call themselves brave? Because they have\nnot sense enough to be afraid to die. Within the last year the world\nhas produced millions of heroes. Has it produced more than one Inca? [He\nresumes his seat.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Fortunately not, Captain. I'd rather marry Chips.\n\nTHE INCA [making a wry face]. Chips! Oh no: I wouldn't marry Chips.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Why?\n\nTHE INCA [whispering the secret]. Chips talks too much about himself.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Well, what about Snooks?\n\nTHE INCA. Snooks? Who is he? Have I a son named Snooks? There are so\nmany--[wearily] so many--that I often forget. [Casually.] But I wouldn't\nmarry him, anyhow, if I were you.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But hasn't any of them inherited the family genius? Surely,\nif Providence has entrusted them with the care of Perusalem--if they are\nall descended from Bedrock the Great--\n\nTHE INCA [interrupting her impatiently]. Madam, if you ask me, I\nconsider Bedrock a grossly overrated monarch.\n\nERMYNTRUDE [shocked]. Oh, Captain! Take care! Incadisparagement.\n\nTHE INCA. I repeat, grossly overrated. Strictly between ourselves, I\ndo not believe all this about Providence entrusting the care of sixty\nmillion human beings to the abilities of Chips and the Piffler and Jack\nJohnson. I believe in individual genius. That is the Inca's secret. It\nmust be. Why, hang it all, madam, if it were a mere family matter, the\nInca's uncle would have been as great a man as the Inca. And--well,\neverybody knows what the Inca's uncle was.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. My experience is that the relatives of men of genius are\nalways the greatest duffers imaginable.\n\nTHE INCA. Precisely. That is what proves that the Inca is a man of\ngenius. His relatives ARE duffers.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But bless my soul, Captain, if all the Inca's generals are\nincapables, and all his relatives duffers, Perusalem will be beaten in\nthe war; and then it will become a republic, like France after 1871, and\nthe Inca will be sent to St Helena.\n\nTHE INCA [triumphantly]. That is just what the Inca is playing for,\nmadam. It is why he consented to the war.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What!\n\nTHE INCA. Aha! The fools talk of crushing the Inca; but they little know\ntheir man. Tell me this. Why did St Helena extinguish Napoleon?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I give it up.\n\nTHE INCA. Because, madam, with certain rather remarkable qualities,\nwhich I should be the last to deny, Napoleon lacked versatility. After\nall, any fool can be a soldier: we know that only too well in Perusalem,\nwhere every fool is a soldier. But the Inca has a thousand other\nresources. He is an architect. Well, St Helena presents an unlimited\nfield to the architect. He is a painter: need I remind you that St\nHelena is still without a National Gallery? He is a composer: Napoleon\nleft no symphonies in St Helena. Send the Inca to St Helena, madam,\nand the world will crowd thither to see his works as they crowd now to\nAthens to see the Acropolis, to Madrid to see the pictures of Velasquez,\nto Bayreuth to see the music dramas of that egotistical old rebel\nRichard Wagner, who ought to have been shot before he was forty, as\nindeed he very nearly was. Take this from me: hereditary monarchs are\nplayed out: the age for men of genius has come: the career is open to\nthe talents: before ten years have elapsed every civilized country from\nthe Carpathians to the Rocky Mountains will be a Republic.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Then goodbye to the Inca.\n\nTHE INCA. On the contrary, madam, the Inca will then have his first real\nchance. He will be unanimously invited by those Republics to return from\nhis exile and act as Superpresident of all the republics.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. But won't that be a come-down for him? Think of it! after\nbeing Inca, to be a mere President!\n\nTHE INCA. Well, why not! An Inca can do nothing. He is tied hand and\nfoot. A constitutional monarch is openly called an India-rubber stamp.\nAn emperor is a puppet. The Inca is not allowed to make a speech: he\nis compelled to take up a screed of flatulent twaddle written by\nsome noodle of a minister and read it aloud. But look at the American\nPresident! He is the Allerhochst, if you like. No, madam, believe me,\nthere is nothing like Democracy, American Democracy. Give the people\nvoting papers: good long voting papers, American fashion; and while the\npeople are reading the voting papers the Government does what it likes.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. What! You too worship before the statue of Liberty, like the\nAmericans?\n\nTHE INCA. Not at all, madam. The Americans do not worship the statue\nof Liberty. They have erected it in the proper place for a statue of\nLiberty: on its tomb [he turns down his moustaches.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [laughing]. Oh! You'd better not let them hear you say that,\nCaptain.\n\nTHE INCA. Quite safe, madam: they would take it as a joke. [He rises.]\nAnd now, prepare yourself for a surprise. [She rises]. A shock. Brace\nyourself. Steel yourself. And do not be afraid.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Whatever on earth can you be going to tell me, Captain?\n\nTHE INCA. Madam, I am no captain. I--\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are the Inca in disguise.\n\nTHE INCA. Good heavens! how do you know that? Who has betrayed me?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How could I help divining it, Sir? Who is there in the world\nlike you? Your magnetism--\n\nTHE INCA. True: I had forgotten my magnetism. But you know now that\nbeneath the trappings of Imperial Majesty there is a Man: simple, frank,\nmodest, unaffected, colloquial: a sincere friend, a natural human being,\na genial comrade, one eminently calculated to make a woman happy. You,\non the other hand, are the most charming woman I have ever met. Your\nconversation is wonderful. I have sat here almost in silence, listening\nto your shrewd and penetrating account of my character, my motives, if I\nmay say so, my talents. Never has such justice been done me: never have\nI experienced such perfect sympathy. Will you--I hardly know how to put\nthis--will you be mine?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Oh, Sir, you are married.\n\nTHE INCA. I am prepared to embrace the Mahometan faith, which allows a\nman four wives, if you will consent. It will please the Turks. But I had\nrather you did not mention it to the Inca-ess. If you don't mind.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. This is really charming of you. But the time has come for\nme to make a revelation. It is your Imperial Majesty's turn now to brace\nyourself. To steel yourself. I am not the princess. I am--\n\nTHE INCA. The daughter of my old friend Archdeacon Daffodil Donkin,\nwhose sermons are read to me every evening after dinner. I never forget\na face.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You knew all along!\n\nTHE INCA [bitterly, throwing himself into his chair]. And you supposed\nthat I, who have been condemned to the society of princesses all my\nwretched life, believed for a moment that any princess that ever walked\ncould have your intelligence!\n\nERMYNTRUDE. How clever of you, Sir! But you cannot afford to marry me.\n\nTHE INCA [springing up]. Why not?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You are too poor. You have to eat war bread. Kings nowadays\nbelong to the poorer classes. The King of England does not even allow\nhimself wine at dinner.\n\nTHE INCA [delighted]. Haw! Ha ha! Haw! haw! [He is convulsed with\nlaughter, and, finally has to relieve his feelings by waltzing half round\nthe room.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE. You may laugh, Sir; but I really could not live in that\nstyle. I am the widow of a millionaire, ruined by your little war.\n\nTHE INCA. A millionaire! What are millionaires now, with the world\ncrumbling?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Excuse me: mine was a hyphenated millionaire.\n\nTHE INCA. A highfalutin millionaire, you mean. [Chuckling]. Haw! ha ha!\nreally very nearly a pun, that. [He sits down in her chair.]\n\nERMYNTRUDE [revolted, sinking into his chair]. I think it quite the\nworst pun I ever heard.\n\nTHE INCA. The best puns have all been made years ago: nothing remained\nbut to achieve the worst. However, madam [he rises majestically; and she\nis about to rise also]. No: I prefer a seated audience [she falls back\ninto her seat at the imperious wave of his hand]. So [he clicks his\nheels]. Madam, I recognize my presumption in having sought the honor\nof your hand. As you say, I cannot afford it. Victorious as I am, I am\nhopelessly bankrupt; and the worst of it is, I am intelligent enough\nto know it. And I shall be beaten in consequence, because my most\nimplacable enemy, though only a few months further away from bankruptcy\nthan myself, has not a ray of intelligence, and will go on fighting\nuntil civilization is destroyed, unless I, out of sheer pity for the\nworld, condescend to capitulate.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. The sooner the better, Sir. Many fine young men are dying\nwhile you wait.\n\nTHE INCA [flinching painfully]. Why? Why do they do it?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Because you make them.\n\nTHE INCA. Stuff! How can I? I am only one man; and they are millions.\nDo you suppose they would really kill each other if they didn't want\nto, merely for the sake of my beautiful eyes? Do not be deceived by\nnewspaper claptrap, madam. I was swept away by a passion not my own,\nwhich imposed itself on me. By myself I am nothing. I dare not walk down\nthe principal street of my own capital in a coat two years old, though\nthe sweeper of that street can wear one ten years old. You talk of\ndeath as an unpopular thing. You are wrong: for years I gave them art,\nliterature, science, prosperity, that they might live more abundantly;\nand they hated me, ridiculed me, caricatured me. Now that I give them\ndeath in its frightfullest forms, they are devoted to me. If you doubt\nme, ask those who for years have begged our taxpayers in vain for a\nfew paltry thousands to spend on Life: on the bodies and minds of the\nnation's children, on the beauty and healthfulness of its cities, on\nthe honor and comfort of its worn-out workers. They refused: and because\nthey refused, death is let loose on them. They grudged a few hundreds\na year for their salvation: they now pay millions a day for their own\ndestruction and damnation. And this they call my doing! Let them say it,\nif they dare, before the judgment-seat at which they and I shall answer\nat last for what we have left undone no less than for what we have done.\n[Pulling himself together suddenly.] Madam, I have the honor to be your\nmost obedient [he clicks his heels and bows].\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Sir! [She curtsies.]\n\nTHE INCA [turning at the door]. Oh, by the way, there is a princess,\nisn't there, somewhere on the premises?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. There is. Shall I fetch her?\n\nTHE INCA [dubious], Pretty awful, I suppose, eh?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. About the usual thing.\n\nTHE INCA [sighing]. Ah well! What can one expect? I don't think I need\ntrouble her personally. Will you explain to her about the boys?\n\nERMYNTRUDE. I am afraid the explanation will fall rather flat without\nyour magnetism.\n\nTHE INCA [returning to her and speaking very humanly]. You are making\nfun of me. Why does everybody make fun of me? Is it fair?\n\nERMYNTRUDE [seriously]. Yes, it is fair. What other defence have we poor\ncommon people against your shining armor, your mailed fist, your pomp\nand parade, your terrible power over us? Are these things fair?\n\nTHE INCA. Ah, well, perhaps, perhaps. [He looks at his watch.] By the\nway, there is time for a drive round the town and a cup of tea at the\nZoo. Quite a bearable band there: it does not play any patriotic airs.\nI am sorry you will not listen to any more permanent arrangement; but if\nyou would care to come--\n\nERMYNTRUDE [eagerly]. Ratherrrrrr. I shall be delighted.\n\nTHE INCA [cautiously]. In the strictest honor, you understand.\n\nERMYNTRUDE. Don't be afraid. I promise to refuse any incorrect\nproposals.\n\nTHE INCA [enchanted]. Oh! Charming woman: how well you understand men!\n\nHe offers her his arm: they go out together.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Inca of Perusalem, by George Bernard Shaw\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INCA OF PERUSALEM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3486-8.txt or 3486-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/4/8/3486/\n\nProduced by Eve Sobol\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nQuestion:\nWho was the Inca disguised as when he met Ermyntrude?\n\nAnswer:\n",
