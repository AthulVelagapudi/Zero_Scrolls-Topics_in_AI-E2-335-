    "va-sq-11": "The User Interface proposed to give up the idea of a hand-held model and give its way to the voice recognition system, while the Industrial Design thought it would be necessary for remote control to be able to be held in hand. Industrial Design believed that not all the people would always use the voice recognition system and most of the time they have to take it by hand. For most, voice recognition is only a kind of addition. If the remote control was not in a suitable shape, like something round, it would bring some troubles.",
    "va-sq-50": "The industrial designer provided several options respectively for energy, material and interface. Among these options, the industrial designer preferred traditional battery, titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition. After that, the user interface designer proposed an LCD display only for output, which might be taken into account. The group also talked about how to enable the users to find their controllers.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing found that trends were quite the same in many areas. Take this year's fruit and vegetable as an example, it applies to everything from clothing to furniture, which meant it was quite general. It might be surprising that people liked products that looked natural and round rather than some futuristic remote control with angles and titanium.",
    "va-sq-58": "To follow the trend of fruit and vegetable, there were two options: something in titanium and smelling like fruit, or something spongy and fruity-like. The industrial designer would explore these two choices and he also suggested having two different assemblies, but the project manager said they couldn't have both. The project manager also mentioned another solution - painting the controller to pretend that it was titanium. The group didn't make a final decision.",
    "va-gq-66": "This meeting was about the detailed design. Firstly, User Interface presented on the prototype, including the shape, the size of the remote and the user interface including the buttons and the scrolling wheel. Next, the group had an evaluation criterion on the prototype. They scored an overall six point five average on the prototype and thought they had done well on it. Then, the group had a discussion about project finance. The group decided not to have a sample sensor and the locator because they had a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Lastly, the group had a discussion about the project process, including the use of a pen, the whiteboard and the PowerPoint. Also, the group was satisfied with Project Manager's leadership and Project Manager also mentioned that their costs were within the budget as well as some admin work.",
    "va-gq-93": "This meeting was about the Welsh Government's childcare offer. During the whole process, Huw Irranca-Davies, Jo-Anne Daniels, and Owain Lloyd answered questions given.The first topic was about the situation of early implementer local authority areas, mentioning what it had learned and the burden they had met. Turning to the childcare offer itself, Huw Irranca-Davies answered several questions regarding its quality and growth. Next, hourly rates of the service and workforce capacity had been emphasized, followed by the discussion of public policy. Moreover, the meeting talked about the impact on children as well as school readiness. The last part was mainly about the assessment of the income levels of each family.",
    "va-sq-108": "Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan agreed with Dawn Bowden that this was about ColegauCymru's negotiation. They would keep a close eye on this situation, but they would wait for the outcome of the negotiations of ColegauCymru before they take any serious steps. They had listened and spoken to ColegauCymru and were aware of what the unions were saying. However, at this point, they had no idea where the settlement was likely to fall.",
    "va-sq-125": "Besides the crisis care, Vaughan Gething also claimed that they did not stop the perinatal mental health service either. However, there were still some problems. For example, because of the shut down of many public services, there might be not enough inpatient care for the pregnant, and less women were willing to resort to such service during the outbreak. Therefore, apart from providing enough inpatient care like the hospital beds, they would also pay attention to how to encourage the mothers to enjoy their service.",
    "va-sq-145": "The project manager wants to sell the remote internationally for 25 euros and keep its cost under 12.50 euros to meet the global profit target of 50 million euros. But project managers don't calculate exactly how much they want to sell.",
    "va-gq-166": "The meeting began with a discussion on the TORRENT project completion being pushed for two years. Grad F then introduced intermediate categorization, which was his topic for his qualification exams. The team then discussed mean subtraction from SRI. Using it had led to an improvement in Meeting Recorder digits though near mic performance worsened. The professor points to pre-echoes as the culprit. The team continued to study differences between SRI and Aurora. The team thought it would be interesting to do the Aurora tests with the SRI system instead of the HTK. The team was also exploring the Wiener filter and VTS. The professor did not seem too excited about the VTS.",
    "va-sq-179": "There were two groups, the young and trendy, and the old and rich. For the first group, they would like fruit and vegetables as a theme for clothes, shoes, and also products. And for the material, a spongy feeling one would be better. But the old and rich would like dark colors, simple, and recognizable shapes as well as familiar material, wood especially.",
    "va-sq-184": "Angela Burns AM shared with the findings from multiple representations from students and brought up the concerns of the consistency of funding. Dr David Blaney commented that causing a run was a serious consideration and it was a legal obligation to meet the commitments. So the current structural change would not equal that certain offshoots or divisions might close since the oversight and monitoring, the governments' primary consideration was always the interest of the students. Unless there was a suitable solution to all, material uncertainty for students should not be brought up.",
    "va-sq-186": "Dr David Blaney believed that governing bodies were not likely to exhibit as an imprudent risk appetite since they would see the potential risks coming through in forecasts, in requests for borrowings, predominantly and many other ways. Although the government body included a slightly different perspective, divisions were not falling short. Besides, commitments from enthusiastic people and occasionally with a slightly external perspective would also be a help.",
    "va-sq-216": "He suggested that the remote control must look good and be brightly coloured. Although not colourful, they could choose a variety of monochrome to meet the aesthetic needs of children, thus improving the suitability of the remote control for children.",
    "va-sq-219": "Project Manager wanted to make a profit of 50 million euros for a cost of 12.50 euros for 25 euros worldwide.",
    "va-sq-225": "The group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data. Recognition performance was very good, indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information, e.g. prosody and overlapping speech. It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.",
    "va-sq-250": "The Prime Minister clarified that while young people are in need of funds, especially due to loss of income over the summer, they are also in need of work experience. The government would start providing the Canada emergency student benefit which will assist in this by making both jobs and money available.",
    "va-sq-258": "The professor recounted that the person who worked with positional parameters, Mark Randolph, is at Motorola. He explained that his model consisted of many continuous variables and that heading in that direction would become a research project in and of itself.",
    "va-sq-264": "Project Manager believed that it could not be heavy. Industrial Designer indicated that fewer and bigger buttons are better and should be bust-free, for instance, rubber could be used on it. Industrial Designer also suggested that when users push a button, they could hear some sort of bleep. User Interface suggested a LED on the corner and not too expensive material like plastic could be used. Marketing added that it should look nice for better sales and should work with as many as possible of existing products listed on their website. Industrial Designer also concluded that it should be battery-saving."
