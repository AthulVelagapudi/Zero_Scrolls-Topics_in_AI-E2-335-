The IDFC will have a broad range of authorities, including the ability to make loans, guarantees, and equity investments, as well as provide insurance and technical assistance. The IDFC will be funded through a Corporate Capital Account and will have a maximum exposure limit of $60 billion. The IDFC's activities will be guided by a set of statutory parameters, including a preference for U.S. sponsors, countries in compliance with international trade obligations, worker rights, environmental and social impact, women's economic empowerment, countries embracing private enterprise, and small business support. The IDFC's decision to support projects will be guided by a set of criteria, including the need to alleviate credit market imperfections, achieve specified goals of U.S. development or foreign policy, and ensure that support is additional to private sector resources. The IDFC's activities will be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and the agency will be required to report to Congress on its activities and outcomes. The IDFC's authorities will terminate seven years after the date of the enactment of the act, and the agency will be required to liquidate its portfolio within a reasonable time after the termination of its authorities. \n\nNote: The report is a compilation of information from various sources, including the BUILD Act, and is intended to provide a general overview of the IDFC's authorities and operations. It is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive analysis of the IDFC's capabilities or limitations. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$\n\nExplanation: The maximum contingent liability (overall portfolio) that the IDFC can have outstanding at any one time cannot exceed $60 billion. This is stated in Section 1433 of the BUILD Act. \n\nNote: The other options are not correct because:\n\n* The IDFC's exposure limit is not $29 billion, as stated in the report.\n* The IDFC's funding is not limited to $23.2 billion, as stated in the report.\n* The IDFC's authorities do not terminate after 7 years, as stated in the report.\n* The IDFC's funding is not limited to $79.2 million, as stated in the report.\n* The IDFC's funding is not limited to $20 million, as stated in the report.\n* The IDFC's funding is not limited to $10 million, as stated in the report. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $60 billion.",

The programs include crop insurance, the Supplemental Agriculture Disaster Assistance Program (SADAP), the Supplemental Revenue Loss Assistance Program (SRLAP), the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP). The programs are administered by various USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The programs provide financial assistance to producers to repair damaged land, replant or rehabilitate trees, and cover losses due to crop failure, livestock disease, and other disasters. The programs also provide technical assistance to help producers recover from disasters. The USDA also has authority to issue disaster payments to farmers with \"Section 32\" or \"CCC\" funds and can use existing programs to address disaster issues as they arise. The USDA's disaster assistance programs are subject to annual appropriations and can be modified or expanded by Congress. The 2018 farm bill made significant changes to the disaster assistance programs, including expanding crop insurance and NAP policies, increasing payment limits, and creating separate payment limits for catastrophic and buy-up coverage. The 2018 farm bill also authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance. The USDA has also taken administrative actions to assist producers, including extending emergency grazing and haying on CRP acres and reducing the emergency loan interest rate.

The report makes four recommendations to GSA to improve its consideration of O&M costs and functionality in the design and construction of new buildings. The recommendations include updating procedures to require GSA officials to estimate O&M costs, obtain information from building and regional managers, consider the impact of design choices on building functionality, and systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. The report also includes recommendations for congressional action to ensure that GSA considers O&M costs and functionality in the design and construction of new buildings. The report is based on a review of GSA procedures, policies, and standards for designing, constructing, and operating federal facilities, including specific policies and procedures for Design Excellence buildings, as well as prior GAO work and reports from other federal agencies and related professional organizations. The report assesses the reliability of data and the survey results, and includes recommendations for GSA to improve its consideration of O&M costs and functionality in the design and construction of new buildings.

    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a program called the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) that transfers excess controlled property to law enforcement agencies. The program is administered by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The report highlights the benefits of the LESO program, including the transfer of property to enhance counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. The report also highlights the deficiencies in the program, including weaknesses in the verification and approval process, the transfer of property, and the assessment of risk.\n\nThe report found that DLA has taken some steps to address weaknesses in the program, including revising its policy and procedures for transferring and monitoring excess controlled property. However, the report also found that DLA lacks a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nThe report made four recommendations to DLA, including reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials transfer controlled property verify that persons picking up items have valid identification and are authorized to pick up allocated property, issuing guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe report also highlighted the benefits of the LESO program, including the transfer of property to enhance counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. The report noted that federal, state, and local agencies have reported using the transferred property for a variety of law enforcement activities, including search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects, police training, and serving warrants.\n\nThe report concluded that DLA\u2019s internal controls did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud, and that conducting a fraud risk assessment could have program-wide improvements, including strengthening the controls to verify the legitimacy of applicants.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the importance of the LESO program in supporting law enforcement agencies, while also identifying areas for improvement in the program\u2019s administration and management. The report makes recommendations to DLA to address the identified weaknesses and to strengthen the program\u2019s internal controls.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of U.S. businesses to determine the effect of the transaction on the national security of the United States. The report examines changes in CFIUS workload and staffing from 2011 to 2016 and provides information on stakeholder views on potential changes to CFIUS. The report finds that the number of covered transactions reviewed by CFIUS increased by 55% from 2011 to 2016, while the number of staff assigned to CFIUS activities increased by 11% over the same period. The report also finds that CFIUS member agencies face challenges in completing core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures, due to staff constraints. The report recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury coordinate member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Treasury should coordinate member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions.\n2. The Secretary of the Treasury should work with Congress to consider legislative changes to CFIUS that could increase the committee's workload and ensure that any changes are implemented in a way that does not compromise the committee's ability to fulfill its objectives.\n\nNote: The report is a summary of the full report, which is not included here.

    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of collegiate aviation schools with professional pilot degree programs. The review aimed to identify challenges faced by these schools in producing professional pilots and their responses to these challenges. The GAO found that the cost of flight training is a significant challenge for many schools, with costs exceeding $100,000. The cost of flight training is a major deterrent for many students, and the GAO notes that the maximum federal financial aid available to eligible students is well below the full cost of a collegiate flight education. The GAO also found that the cost of purchasing and maintaining aircraft is a challenge for some schools, and that the VA education benefit program has restrictions on contracted flight instruction. The GAO recommends that the Department of Education and the Department of Veterans Affairs consider revising their policies to make it easier for students to access flight training and to reduce the cost of flight training. The GAO also recommends that the Department of Transportation consider providing incentives for airlines to offer scholarships to students. The GAO's report highlights the need for a coordinated effort among government agencies, airlines, and industry stakeholders to address the challenges facing collegiate aviation schools and to support the development of a sustainable and affordable pilot training system.\nThe GAO's report also notes that the cost of flight training is a significant challenge for many schools, with costs exceeding $100,000.
