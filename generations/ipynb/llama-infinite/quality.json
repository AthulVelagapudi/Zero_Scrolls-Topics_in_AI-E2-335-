    "22867_IZGAWLCJ_4": " (C) Walter put in false information to make it appear as though the company is thriving.\n\nExplanation: The reports are not accurate. The company is not producing trash cans, but rather is producing a large quantity of titanium-steel trash cans. The reports are false, and Walter Towne is using this information to manipulate the union and the company's management. This is evident from the fact that the company is producing more trash cans than it can sell, and that the workers are becoming increasingly restless and agitated. The reports are being used to create a false sense of prosperity and to justify the company's actions, but in reality, the company is facing a crisis. \n\nThe passage is a satirical commentary on the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the manipulation of information. It highlights the ways in which those in power can use false information to control and manipulate others, and the consequences of this manipulation. The passage also touches on the theme of class struggle and the ways in which the wealthy and powerful use their influence to maintain their power and privilege. \n\nThe passage is written in a satirical style, with a tone that is both humorous and critical. The use of irony, sarcasm, and ridicule is used to highlight the absurdity and hypocrisy of the situation. The passage also uses a variety of literary devices, such as metaphor (the comparison of the machines to a \"soul-rending, teeth-grating, bone-rattling screech\") and allusion (the reference to the \"factory whistle\"), to create a sense of tension and drama. \n\nThe passage is also notable for its use of a non-linear narrative structure. The story is presented in a series of vignettes, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the situation. This structure creates a sense of disjointedness and fragmentation, mirroring the chaos and disorder of the situation. The use of multiple narrative voices and perspectives also adds to the sense of complexity and nuance, highlighting the multiple viewpoints and motivations of the characters. \n\nOverall, the passage is a powerful commentary on the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the manipulation of information. It uses satire and irony to highlight the absurdity and hypocrisy of the situation, and to create a sense of tension and drama. The use of literary devices and non-linear narrative structure adds to the complexity and nuance of the passage, making it a rich and thought-provoking read. \n\nThe passage is also notable for its use of a strong, confident, and charismatic protagonist in Walter Towne.

    "99927_EVLEI3Q2_6": "C) There are no situations where unconditional OA applies\n\nExplanation:\nThe text states that \"none of the three'mandates' absolutely requires OA. Loophole mandates allow some work to escape through the loophole. Deposit mandates allow some deposited work to remain dark (non-OA), by following publisher preferences. Rights-retention mandates with waiver options allow some work to remain dark, by following author preferences.\" This means that there are no situations where truly unconditional OA policy applies.\n\nQuestion and Possible Answers:\nWhat is the main reason why no university policies require OA without qualification?\n\n (A) Because of the lack of funding \n (B) Because of the lack of faculty support \n (C) Because of the need to preserve faculty freedom \n (D) Because of the need to accommodate publishers\n\nAnswer:\nC) Because of the need to preserve faculty freedom\n\nExplanation:\nThe text states that \"even the strongest university policies can\u2019t make tenured faculty comply\" and \"successful policies are implemented through expectations, education, incentives, and assistance, not coercion.\" This suggests that the main reason why no university policies require OA without qualification is to preserve faculty freedom.\n\nQuestion and Possible Answers:\nWhat is the author's main argument for why OA policies should be called \"contracts\" instead of \"mandates\"?\n\n (A) Because it is a more accurate term \n (B) Because it is a more frightening term \n (C) Because it puts the accent on the author's consent to be bound \n (D) Because it is a more convenient term \n\nAnswer:\nC) Because it puts the accent on the author's consent to be bound\n\nExplanation:\nThe text states that \"we do have a good word for policies that use mandatory language for those who agree to be bound. We call them \u201ccontracts.\u201d While \u201ccontract\u201d is short, accurate, and unfrightening, it puts the accent on the author\u2019s consent to be bound.\" This suggests that the author's main argument for why OA policies should be called \"contracts\" instead of \"mandates\" is that it puts the accent on the author's consent to be bound.",
    "31282_BQYW9TCH_4": "(A) Humans are happy to bring their women to Mars as another manipulation tactic against the race. This is not true. The text states that the Martians are not interested in the human women, and that the women from Earth are not interested in the Martians. The text states that the women from Earth \"went on a stand-up strike when they saw and smelled the Martians.\" This suggests that the women from Earth are not interested in the Martians and are not willing to be brought to Mars as a means of manipulation.",

    "32665_VRYQXG3Y_9": "(C) Communication with other species and cultures is a delicate process that needs to be done with care.\n\nExplanation:\nThe story highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the culture and customs of other species. The Arzians, squids, and flying-lizards all have their own unique ways of living and interacting with each other, and the humans' actions have unintended consequences. The story shows that communication and understanding are key to avoiding misunderstandings and conflicts. The characters' mistakes and missteps serve as a cautionary tale about the importance of approaching other cultures with care and respect.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the story:\n\n(A) While exploration can lead to surprises, the story highlights the dangers and unintended consequences of exploration without proper understanding and care.\n\n(B) The story shows that discovery can be fun, but it also comes with risks and challenges that need to be addressed.\n\n(D) The story emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication, rather than independent learning. The characters' successes are often the result of working together and sharing knowledge.\nThe best answer is C"
