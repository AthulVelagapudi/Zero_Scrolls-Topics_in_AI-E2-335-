The Bureau of Reclamation plays a significant role in managing the basin's waters, with a framework established by the Colorado River Compact of 1922. The compact allocates water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the Lower Basin receiving 7.5 million acre-feet annually, while the Upper Basin provides 7.5 million acre-feet. The compact also requires the Upper Basin states to deliver a total of 75 million acre-feet to the Lower Basin over a 10-year period.\n\nThe Colorado River is used for various purposes, including industrial, recreational, and agricultural activities. The river's flow and water quality are affected by factors such as precipitation, runoff, and human activities. The basin's storage and conveyance facilities, including dams and reservoirs, play a crucial role in managing water supplies and generating hydropower.\n\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate drought conditions in the basin, with warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns increasing the likelihood of prolonged drought. The 2012 Reclamation Study projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand in the basin, with a 9% decrease in flows at Lee Ferry and increased demand projected to rise from 15 million acre-feet to 18.1-20.4 million acre-feet by 2050.\n\nTo address these challenges, Congress has implemented various measures, including the 2007 Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, which require Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and contribute to Lake Mead storage. The 2019 Drought Contingency Plan further strengthens these efforts, with specific reductions in supply and additional flexibility to incentivize voluntary conservation.\n\nCongress is also responsible for funding and overseeing existing facilities and programs, including the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program and the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Program. The development of new tribal water supplies and infrastructure, such as the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, is also a priority.\n\nOverall, the Colorado River Basin faces significant challenges in managing its waters, and Congress will need to continue to play a proactive role in addressing these issues to ensure the long-term sustainability of the basin's water resources.",

The FTCA was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by the actions of federal employees and to deter such behavior. The law waives the government's sovereign immunity from liability for certain torts, allowing individuals to bring claims against the government for damages.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years, with some arguing that it provides too much protection for the government and others arguing that it does not go far enough. The law has been amended several times since its enactment, and there have been proposals to modify or abolish it.\n\nThe FTCA applies to claims that arise out of the negligence or wrongful conduct of federal employees, including military personnel, law enforcement officers, and contractors. The law also provides for certain exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity, including claims arising from the exercise of discretion, intentional torts, and combatant activities during times of war.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of numerous court cases, which have established a body of law that governs the application of the law.

To be eligible for benefits, individuals are generally required to actively search for work under federal law. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 amended the Social Security Act to require states to have work search requirements for UI claimants as a condition of eligibility for the state's UI administrative grants.\n\nThe program has a process for identifying work search overpayments, which are payments made to claimants who fail to meet work search requirements. The process involves state benefit accuracy measurement audits, which use a standard claimant questionnaire to determine whether claimants have complied with the state's minimum requirement for the number of weekly work search activities. The audits also involve verifying the information reported by the claimant and contacting employers or other third parties.\n\nThe program has reported causes of UI improper payments, including overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. The leading reported cause of UI improper payments in fiscal year 2017 was overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements, resulting in an estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments. Other major reported causes of UI improper payments included payments made to individuals who continued to make claims even after returning to work and payments made to claimants who were determined ineligible due to disqualifying job separations.\n\nThe program has a trend in reported work search overpayments, with an estimated work search overpayment rate of 4.5 percent in fiscal year 2017, up from 2.4 percent in 2013.

In contrast, design choices like interior natural light, durable materials, and low-maintenance landscaping have reduced O&M costs. The review also found that GSA does not fully consider O&M and functionality effects when making design choices, and that the agency does not systematically collect and share information on the positive and negative effects of design choices on O&M costs in existing buildings.\n\nThe review recommends that GSA update its procedures to require officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and systematically collect and share information on the effects of design choices on O&M costs in existing buildings. Additionally, the review suggests that GSA should consider the extent to which design choices may affect building functionality, such as public accessibility, and strive for the lowest possible costs, including O&M costs, when designing buildings.\n\nThe review found that most Design Excellence buildings generally function well, but some design choices did not improve functionality and were costly to maintain. The review also noted that GSA's one-size-fits-all approach in designing these buildings does not consider whether non-public buildings need the same costly architectural elements as public landmarks. Overall, the review concludes that GSA's Design Excellence Program has achieved excellence in architecture and design, but needs to improve its consideration of O&M costs and functionality in its building design process.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted an audit of the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) excess controlled property program, also known as the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program. The program allows federal law enforcement agencies to acquire excess controlled property from the DLA at no cost. The GAO found that while the program has been used to enhance various law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border security, there are significant weaknesses in the program's management, oversight, and accountability processes.\n\nThe GAO identified several areas of concern, including the lack of adequate verification and approval processes for federal agency applications, inadequate transfer of controlled property, and insufficient fraud prevention and mitigation measures. The audit found that DLA officials did not properly verify the legitimacy of applications, did not require supervisory approval for all applications, and did not conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with program guidelines.\n\nThe GAO also found that DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify the identity of individuals picking up controlled property, and that some sites did not have checklists to ensure accurate tracking and accounting of transferred items. The audit concluded that these weaknesses could lead to the transfer of controlled property to unauthorized individuals or entities, potentially compromising national security.\n\nThe GAO made four recommendations to DLA to address these weaknesses, including revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications, ensuring compliance with transfer procedures, issuing guidance to DLA Disposition Services personnel, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks. DOD concurred with all of these recommendations.\n\nThe GAO's findings highlight the need for DLA to strengthen its internal controls and improve the management of the LESO program to ensure that it is used effectively and securely. The program's benefits, including the acquisition of critical equipment and resources for law enforcement agencies, must be weighed against the risks of fraud and unauthorized transfers.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a committee established by the US government to review foreign acquisitions of US companies to determine if they pose a threat to national security. The committee is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes representatives from various government agencies. CFIUS reviews transactions involving foreign persons that could result in foreign control of a US business engaged in interstate commerce.\n\nThe committee's primary goal is to ensure that foreign investments do not compromise US national security while promoting foreign investment and job creation. To achieve this, CFIUS reviews transactions on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors, including the potential national security-related effects on US critical technologies, the control of US businesses by foreign governments, and the potential impact on US critical infrastructure.\n\nIn recent years, CFIUS has reviewed an increasing number of transactions, with a significant increase in the number of non-notified transactions. The committee's workload has also grown due to the complexity of transactions, including those involving new and emerging technologies. To address these challenges, CFIUS has implemented various measures, such as mitigation measures and presidential action.\n\nHowever, CFIUS has faced concerns about its staffing levels and workload, with some stakeholders expressing concerns that the committee's capacity to complete its core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures, may be limited. To address these concerns, the Secretary of the Treasury has been working with other government agencies to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload.\n\nThe committee's review process typically involves four stages: pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. If CFIUS determines that a transaction poses a national security risk, it may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the transaction. The committee's recommendations are typically made within 30 days of the completion of the national security review.\n\nIn recent years, CFIUS has reviewed a significant number of transactions, including those involving Chinese, UK, and Canadian companies. The manufacturing sector has been the largest contributor to the number of transactions reviewed by CFIUS, with computer and electronic transactions being a significant portion of those reviewed.\n\nOverall, CFIUS plays a critical role in ensuring that foreign investments do not compromise US national security while promoting foreign investment and job creation. However, the committee's workload and staffing levels require careful management to ensure that it can effectively complete its core functions and address the complex challenges posed by emerging technologies and global economic trends.",
    "gao_GAO-18-7": "The National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking and Reducing Demand is a comprehensive plan to combat wildlife trafficking and reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife. The strategy identifies reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife as one of its top priorities, and it calls for raising public awareness of the harms done by wildlife trafficking through outreach in the United States and public diplomacy abroad. The strategy also seeks to enlist individual consumers in this fight through education and outreach to reduce demand for these products and change consumption patterns that drive wildlife trafficking.\n\nThe report highlights the scope of the problem of wildlife trafficking, which is estimated to be worth at least $7 billion annually. It notes that wildlife trafficking networks span the globe and that the trade in wildlife products is diverse, with a range of species and products being consumed.

    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The civil aviation industry in the United States is comprised of two main categories: general aviation and commercial aviation. General aviation encompasses all aviation activities outside of military and commercial airlines, while commercial aviation refers to airlines that carry passengers or cargo for hire or compensation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for regulating the safety of civil aviation in the United States, including pilot certification and safety oversight of pilot training.\n\nTo become a commercial airline pilot, individuals must undergo initial pilot training in the general aviation sector and may receive additional employer-specific training. The FAA sets standards for pilot training programs, which must be met by FAA-certificated schools. These schools must also meet general operating rules and regulations.\n\nThere are three main types of pilot schools: collegiate aviation schools, non-collegiate vocational pilot schools, and non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools. Collegiate aviation schools offer a 2- or 4-year undergraduate degree in an aviation-based major, while non-collegiate vocational pilot schools provide training in a fixed-wing aircraft and do not offer a degree. Non-collegiate, instructor-based pilot schools offer flexible training environments where students can learn at their own pace.\n\nTo become a commercial airline pilot, individuals must obtain a private pilot certificate, instrument rating, commercial pilot certificate, and multi-engine rating. They must also meet the FAA's requirements for flight experience, which currently stands at 1,500 hours. However, regional airlines have begun to require 1,500 hours of flight experience for first officers, and some airlines have set higher requirements.\n\nCollegiate aviation schools face several challenges, including recruiting and retaining flight instructors, which is a key challenge. Flight instructors are often recruited and then leave to become airline pilots, which can limit the number of students who can be trained. Some schools have implemented programs to retain instructors, such as cadet programs that offer incentives for graduates to remain as flight instructors.\n\nThe cost of flight training is also a challenge for some schools. Flight training can be expensive, and many students rely on loans or private funding to pay for the program. Some schools offer scholarships or financial aid to help students cover the costs, but these programs are often limited.\n\nThe industry faces other challenges, including the need for more women and minorities in aviation, and the impact of the 9/11 attacks on the industry. The FAA has implemented various regulations and programs to address these challenges and ensure the safety of the industry.\n\nIn summary, the civil aviation industry in the United States faces several challenges, including recruiting and retaining flight instructors"
