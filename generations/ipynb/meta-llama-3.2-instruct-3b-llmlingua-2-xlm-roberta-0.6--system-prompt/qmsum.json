It was mentioned that people wearing microphones like the ones used by Grad E were the easiest way to wear them. The microphone used by Grad H was described as being placed over the temples, and Grad F mentioned that it was a good idea to test the microphone with a test signal. \n\nThe conversation then shifted to the issue of downsampling, with Grad E suggesting that downsampling could be done in real-time without having to use a separate computer program. Grad F agreed that this would be a good idea, but noted that it might not be possible to downsample in real-time. \n\nThe discussion also touched on the issue of the sampling rate, with Grad E mentioning that the sampling rate of 48 kHz was a standard for digital audio. Grad C suggested that using a sampling rate of 16 kHz might be sufficient for the microphone data, but Grad E was unsure. \n\nThe conversation also mentioned the use of a headset microphone, with Grad F suggesting that it might be a good idea to use one. Grad C agreed that it would be a good idea, but noted that it might be expensive. Grad E mentioned that the headset microphone was $800, which was a significant amount of money. \n\nOverall, the discussion about microphone data was focused on finding the best way to record and process the audio data, and the different options that were being considered.",
