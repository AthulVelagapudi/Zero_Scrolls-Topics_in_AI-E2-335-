The IDFC's mission is to provide private capital and skills to developing and transition countries, with a focus on low-income and lower-middle-income economies. The corporation will have the authority to make loans, guarantees, and issue insurance or reinsurance, as well as take minority equity positions in investments.\n\nThe IDFC's organizational structure will be similar to that of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), with a Board of Directors composed of five members, including the Secretary of State, the USAID Administrator, and three non-governmental members. The Board will be responsible for overseeing the IDFC's operations and making decisions on project support.\n\nThe IDFC's performance will be evaluated through a performance measurement system, which will include metrics such as development impact, economic growth, and poverty reduction. The corporation will be required to submit annual reports to Congress, including an assessment of its economic and social development impact.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be subject to oversight by the Inspector General and the Risk Committee and Audit Committee, which will ensure that the corporation's operations are transparent, accountable, and compliant with environmental, social, and labor standards.\n\nThe IDFC will have a limited exposure limit of $60 billion and will be funded through a Corporate Capital Account, which will include fees for services, interest earnings, and transfers of unexpended balances from predecessor agencies.\n\nThe IDFC's decision to support projects will be guided by the principle of additionality, meaning that the corporation will only provide support if it is necessary to alleviate a credit market imperfection or to achieve a specified goal of U.S. development or foreign policy. The corporation will also consider the impact of its support on women's economic opportunities and outcomes.\n\nThe IDFC's operations will be subject to various restrictions, including limitations on support for a single entity, boycotts, and sanctions. The corporation will also be required to maintain a user-friendly, publicly available database with detailed project-level information.\n\nThe IDFC's implementation will be overseen by Congress, which will review the reorganization plan and impact on U.S. foreign policy objectives. The corporation's capacity to balance its mission to support U.S. businesses with its development mandate will be a key issue for policymakers to consider.\n\nOverall, the IDFC represents a significant shift in U.S. development finance efforts, with the goal of promoting private investment in support of U.S",
    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was established by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The 1996 welfare reform law provided both program authority and funding for TANF through the end of FY2002. The law repealed AFDC and some of its related programs, replacing them with TANF, which is a block grant that provides funding to states to support low-income families with children.\n\nThe TANF block grant is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is funded by the federal government. States are required to administer TANF programs, and they have significant flexibility in designing their programs and allocating funds. The law also established a five-year block grant period, during which states must make significant progress in reducing their caseloads and promoting self-sufficiency.\n\nThe TANF block grant has undergone several reauthorizations since its establishment, with some changes to its funding and requirements. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, for example, extended TANF funding through FY2010 and made some changes to the program's work requirements. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided additional funding for TANF and established a TANF Emergency Contingency Fund to support states during times of economic downturn.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to reauthorize and reform the TANF block grant. The FY2017 TANF bill, for example, extended TANF funding through FY2017 and made some changes to the program's work requirements. The FY2019 TANF bill, signed into law by President Trump, extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.\n\nOverall, the TANF block grant has played a critical role in supporting low-income families with children in the United States, but its funding and requirements have undergone significant changes over the years in response to shifting economic and social conditions.",

The Bureau of Reclamation plays a significant role in managing the basin's waters, and the federal government has a prominent role in the management of the Colorado River. The river's flow and water are used for irrigation, municipal, industrial, and power generation, with a majority of water supplies going to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land and provide municipal and industrial water supplies to nearly 40 million people.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework for apportioning water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the dividing line at Lee Ferry, Arizona. The compact also authorized the construction of storage and conveyance facilities, including the Boulder Canyon Project, which included the Hoover Dam and the All-American Canal. The compact was modified by the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, which ratified the 1922 compact and authorized the construction of additional storage projects in the Upper Basin.\n\nThe Arizona v. California decision in 1963 ruled that Congress had intended to apportion the mainstream of the Colorado River, and that California and Arizona each would receive one-half of surplus flows. The decision also held that Section 5 of the BCPA controlled the apportionment of waters among Lower Basin states.\n\nThe 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty established water allocations for the two countries and created a governance framework to resolve disputes arising from the treaty's execution. The treaty requires the United States to provide Mexico with 1.5 million acre-feet of water annually, plus an additional 200,000 acre-feet when a surplus is declared.\n\nThe Upper Basin Compact established Colorado River allocations for the seven basin states, with Colorado receiving the largest allocation. The compact also established the Upper Colorado River Commission, which coordinates operations and positions among Upper Basin states.\n\nThe Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) was authorized in 1956 to provide storage and conveyance facilities for the Upper Basin. The CRSP includes 16 participating projects, including the Glen Canyon Dam and the Navajo Dam.\n\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead were developed to address drought conditions and provide additional flexibility to incentivize voluntary conservation of water to be stored in Lake Mead. The guidelines require Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and contribute additional water to Lake Mead storage at predetermined trigger elevations.\n\nThe ",

The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity from liability for certain claims, allowing individuals to seek compensation for injuries or damages caused by the actions of federal employees or contractors.\n\nThe FTCA was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by the actions of federal employees or contractors, which were previously barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The law allows individuals to bring civil lawsuits against the United States for certain torts, including negligence, personal injury, and property damage, as well as for wrongful death.\n\nThe FTCA has several key provisions that limit the types of claims that can be brought against the United States. These include:\n\n1. The discretionary function exception, which bars claims arising from conduct that is within the scope of an employee's duties and is discretionary in nature.\n2. The intentional tort exception, which excludes claims arising from intentional acts, such as assault and battery.\n3. The law enforcement proviso, which waives immunity for claims arising from the actions of law enforcement officers.\n4. The foreign country exception, which bars claims arising from conduct that occurs outside the United States.\n5. The combatant activities exception, which excludes claims arising from conduct that occurs during wartime.\n6. The Feres doctrine, which bars claims arising from injuries sustained while in the course of military service.\n7. The statute of limitations and exhaustion provisions, which limit the time period within which claims can be brought and require individuals to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit.\n\nThe FTCA also has several procedural requirements, including the need for plaintiffs to notify the relevant federal agency and to file a claim within a specified time period. The law also limits the types of damages that can be awarded, including the prohibition on punitive damages and prejudgment interest.\n\nOverall, the FTCA provides a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by the actions of federal employees or contractors, while also providing a framework for the federal government to manage its liability and ensure that it is not unduly exposed to tort liability.",

These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans. Most of these programs have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program requires a federal disaster designation.\n\nThe federal crop insurance program is designed to protect crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, plant diseases, and declines in commodity prices. The program provides crop yield and price coverage, with premiums subsidized by the federal government. The premium for catastrophic coverage is completely subsidized, and producers can receive a payment to the estimated market value of the commodity on crop losses of 50% or more of normal yield.\n\nThe NAP program provides assistance to producers who grow crops that are not eligible for crop insurance. The program pays 55% of the average market price for losses in excess of 50% of normal historical production. Producers can also purchase additional coverage, known as buy-up coverage, at 50% to 65% of established yield and 100% of average market price.\n\nThe Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides assistance to eligible livestock owners and growers for livestock deaths due to eligible loss conditions such as extreme weather, disease, or animal attack. The program pays 75% of the average fair market value of the deceased animal type.\n\nThe Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) makes payments to eligible producers who suffered losses on forage land due to drought or fire. The program pays 60% of the estimated monthly feed cost for drought-affected counties.\n\nThe Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions.\n\nThe Tree Assistance Program (TAP) makes payments to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.\n\nThe USDA also offers emergency disaster loans to agricultural producers in disaster-affected areas. The loans can be used to help producers recover from production losses or physical losses such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment.\n\nIn addition to these programs, the USDA has several permanent disaster assistance programs that help producers repair damaged land following natural disasters.

The plan includes 55 new ships per year, with a focus on increasing the number of attack submarines and large surface combatants. The Navy's 30-year plan is expected to take into account the Trump Administration's National Security Strategy document and its January 2018 National Defense Strategy document, which emphasize renewed great power competition with China and Russia.\n\nThe Navy's shipbuilding plans have been a matter of oversight focus for several years, particularly since the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The plan's prospective affordability has been a concern, particularly during the decade or so from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, when the plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and replacing large numbers of retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers.\n\nThe Columbia-class program is the Navy's top program priority, and funding for the program could crowd out funding for other Navy programs. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, which is an average of 11 new ships per year. The plan also includes funding for ships that have been procured in prior fiscal years and ships that are to be procured in future fiscal years.\n\nThe Navy's 355-ship goal has been a subject of debate, with some observers questioning whether the goal is achievable and whether the Navy's shipbuilding plans are sufficient to meet the Navy's mission requirements.

However, many of these sites are no longer in productive use and contain vast quantities of radioactive and hazardous materials.\n\nEM has spent over $170 billion since its cleanup program began in 1989, but its most challenging and costly cleanup work remains. The cleanup efforts involve multiple stakeholders, including federal facility agreements, compliance orders, and other regulatory requirements. EM manages its cleanup program based on internal guidance, milestone commitments to regulators, and consultation with various stakeholders.\n\nAt EM's 16 cleanup sites, cleanup is governed by 72 agreements and hundreds of cleanup milestones. However, there is a lack of standardization in defining and tracking milestones, leading to inconsistencies in monitoring performance. EM headquarters and site officials have different definitions and tracking methods, making it difficult to monitor progress.\n\nThe EM complex is plagued by missed and postponed milestones, which can lead to cost overruns and delays. The agency has not conducted a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for these missed milestones, and the lack of transparency and accountability hinders the ability to manage and measure the performance of the cleanup program.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act of 2011 requires EM to annually report on the status of its cleanup milestones to Congress. However, EM has only submitted two reports since 2011, and the information provided is incomplete and inaccurate. The absence of reliable and complete information on the progress of EM's cleanup mission limits the agency's ability to manage its mission and oversight by Congress.\n\nThe report recommends that the Assistant Secretary of the DOE's Office of Environmental Management update EM's policies and procedures to establish a standard definition of milestones and specify requirements for tracking and updating information on milestones across the complex.

The report notes that improper payments, including overpayments, have led to billions of federal and state funds being used inappropriately.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of actively seeking work as an eligibility requirement for individuals receiving unemployment benefits under federal law since 2012. However, states have not consistently implemented this requirement for claimants in similar circumstances. States with formal warning policies reported lower work search overpayments not necessarily because they are better at ensuring claimants' compliance with requirements, but because they are not counting cases where claimants receive formal warnings as overpayments.\n\nThe report identifies factors associated with state work search overpayment rates, including the fraction of cases with claimants required to search for work, the fraction of cases for which BAM auditors investigated job contacts, and the use of formal warnings. The analysis suggests that states with more cases with claimants required to search for work and states that issued formal warnings frequently have lower work search overpayment rates.\n\nThe report also notes that some characteristics of cases are associated with work search overpayment rates, including the distribution of cases by claimant age, gender, duration of unemployment benefits receipt, and key week amount as a percentage of the normal weekly wage in their occupation. However, the report emphasizes that the relationship between work search overpayment rates and these characteristics is complex and may be influenced by various factors.\n\nThe report recommends that the Department of Labor (DOL) should provide clearer direction to states on verifying work search and monitoring state compliance, and that DOL should clarify its BAM procedures to ensure that states are complying with its requirements. The report also recommends that DOL should provide more guidance on the use of formal warnings and the monitoring of states' efforts to discontinue the use of formal warning policies.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the need for states and DOL to work together to improve the administration of the UI program and reduce improper payments, including work search overpayments.",

Generalists work in one of five career tracks: consular, economic, management, political, or public diplomacy. Specialists support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts, ensuring the security and maintenance of facilities, computer networks, and supplies.\n\nHowever, the report highlights persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts. As of March 31, 2018, 13% of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, similar to the percentages in 2012 and 2008. The vacancy rate is higher in specialist positions, with 14.2% of all overseas Foreign Service specialist positions vacant.\n\nThe report identifies several challenges in recruiting and hiring Foreign Service employees to fill specialist positions, particularly those requiring specialized skills and competencies. Vacancies in critical positions, such as security officer and information management, have adverse effects on diplomatic readiness and security. Vacancies in political and economic career tracks also limit the amount of reporting on political and economic developments that posts can submit to State headquarters.\n\nThe report notes that State officials have described various efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. State lacks an action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies and suggests corrective measures to reduce such vacancies.\n\nThe report concludes that Foreign Service generalists and specialists at overseas posts are critical to advancing U.S. foreign policy and economic interests abroad. However, persistent vacancies in certain positions, such as information management and security, threaten the agency's ability to carry out its mission and compromise employee safety.\n\nThe report makes several recommendations, including the development of an integrated action plan to address persistent Foreign Service vacancies, which should include steps necessary to implement solutions.

The program aims to create buildings that are cost-effective, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. However, a review of 78 federal buildings constructed under the program found that some design choices have increased operational and maintenance (O&M) costs, while others have decreased them.\n\nGSA has made choices that have reduced O&M costs, such as incorporating natural light, using durable and low-maintenance materials, and designing spaces that are easy to clean. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles, California, features a light well and serrated glass fa\u00e7ade that maximizes natural light, reducing energy costs and the need for frequent lighting replacements.\n\nOn the other hand, some design choices have increased O&M costs, such as multistory atriums and lobbies, large custom windows, and separate structures. These features have led to increased energy costs, repair costs, and maintenance challenges. For instance, the Albert Armendariz, Sr., U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, Texas, has a three-story window wall and front atrium that provide ample light, but also require expensive scaffolding and mechanical lifts to maintain.\n\nGSA does not fully consider O&M and functionality effects when making design choices. The agency estimates most O&M costs during planning and design, but does not account for the remaining two-thirds of costs, which include maintenance, cleaning, and landscaping. This approach may lead to costly design changes later in the process.\n\nThe review also found that GSA building and regional managers are not always integrated or consulted during the design process, and their input is rarely incorporated or requested. This lack of involvement may result in design choices that are not optimized for O&M costs and functionality.\n\nTo address these issues, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Administrator of the General Services Administration update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate full O&M costs during planning and design, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and consider and document how design choices may affect building functionality. The GAO also recommends that GSA systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.\n\nThe GAO's review highlights the need for GSA to improve its design and planning processes to ensure that federal buildings are cost-effective, functional, and sustainable. By following these recommendations, GSA can reduce O&M costs and improve the overall value of its building portfolio.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The report highlights the various uses and benefits of the Department of Defense's (DOD) excess controlled property (LESO) program for law enforcement agencies. The program allows federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to acquire excess property from the DOD at no cost or at a reduced cost. The report notes that the program has been used for various purposes, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities, as well as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, and police training.\n\nThe report also highlights the benefits of the LESO program, including cost savings for participating agencies. For example, a Texas law enforcement department reported saving an estimated $2 million to $3 million per year due to the program. Additionally, the program has been used to support various law enforcement operations, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Office of Justice Services, which used vehicles to support their drug unit's operations in mountainous and desert environments.\n\nHowever, the report also identifies weaknesses in the LESO program's internal controls, including the lack of adequate verification and approval processes for federal agency applications. The report found that DLA's reliance on electronic communications without actual verification does not allow it to properly vet for potentially fraudulent activity. Additionally, the report notes that DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify valid identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and that the program lacks a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nThe report makes four recommendations for DLA to address these weaknesses, including reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials verify that persons picking up items have valid identification and are authorized to pick up allocated property, issuing guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior to removal from the sites, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks. DOD concurred with all of these recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a committee established by the U.S. government to review and investigate foreign investments in the United States to ensure that they do not pose a threat to national security. The committee was created in 1975 and is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. CFIUS reviews transactions involving foreign persons that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business engaged in interstate commerce.\n\nThe committee's primary goal is to determine whether a transaction poses a national security risk and whether it should be allowed to proceed. To achieve this goal, CFIUS considers a variety of factors, including the potential national security-related effects on U.S. critical technologies, the potential for the foreign party to take action to impair national security, and the potential for the transaction to result in the control of a U.S. business by a foreign government.\n\nCFIUS reviews a wide range of transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, and joint ventures. The committee has reviewed over 172 transactions in 2016, with the majority of them coming from the manufacturing sector. The committee's reviews are confidential and protected from public disclosure.\n\nThe committee's workload has increased significantly over the past few years, with a 55% increase in the number of covered transactions reviewed between 2011 and 2016. The committee's staff has also increased, with 91 staff members assigned to CFIUS activities in 2016. However, the committee has expressed concerns about its ability to complete its core functions, including identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures, due to staff constraints.\n\nThe committee has proposed changes to its structure and procedures to address these concerns, including expanding its membership and increasing its staff. However, the committee's ability to implement these changes is limited by its lack of a centralized budget and authority over staffing levels at member agencies.\n\nOverall, CFIUS plays a critical role in ensuring that foreign investments in the United States do not pose a threat to national security. However, the committee faces significant challenges in completing its core functions due to its increasing workload and staff constraints.",
