    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that trends in remote controls are not just about functionality but also about aesthetics and style. They found that people are looking for remote controls that are not only useful but also have a \"fancy\" look and feel. The marketing also learned that people are willing to pay more for a remote control that is unique and has a distinctive design, such as a shape that resembles a fruit. Additionally, the marketing learned that people tend to change their TV more often than their batteries, so it's better to design the remote control to be easy to use and have a simple design rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion about appearance design of the remote control focuses on making it look modern and trendy, with a focus on fruit and vegetable-inspired shapes, such as a banana or a fruit-like body with titanium panels. The team considers using a spongy or rubber-like material for the body, but it is not feasible due to cost and manufacturing issues. The design should be simple and easy to use, with a limited number of buttons, and the display should provide clear information about the actions. The design should also be easy to clean and maintain. The team agrees that the remote control should be made of titanium or have a titanium-like appearance, and that the design should be aesthetically pleasing and modern. The use of color-changing technology, such as a backlight or a display that changes color depending on the environment, is also discussed. The design should be user-friendly and easy to use, with a focus on making the remote control look and feel like a high-end product.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a final meeting for a product design project. The team discussed the prototype presentation, which showed a remote control designed to look like a banana.

The team evaluated the project against a seven-point scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. The team agreed that the design was intuitive, but had some issues with the scroll wheel and locator. They also discussed the use of a sample sensor and speaker, which were not essential features. The team decided to keep the design and make some minor adjustments. The meeting concluded with the team discussing the project's productivity and the need to complete a final questionnaire and meeting summary.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting was a session of the Children, Young People and Education Committee, where the Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, and his team discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer. The offer provides 30 hours of childcare for 3- to 4-year-olds, with the option to extend it to 48 weeks. The Minister answered questions from committee members on various aspects of the offer, including its implementation, impact on child development, and potential challenges. The committee discussed the offer's design, including the \u00a34.50 hourly rate, the role of the National Day Nurseries Association, and the potential for integration with the UK Government's tax-free childcare offer. The Minister and his team emphasized the importance of learning from early piloting and expanding the offer to more areas, while also addressing concerns about affordability and accessibility. The meeting concluded with a resolution to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that there is still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, and that the trend of filling those places is at 65%. She explained that this is due to various factors, including the fact that 65% of those who are recruited are not from priority subjects, and that there are not enough financial incentives to attract more people into the profession. She mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, including increasing the financial incentives for priority subjects, embarking on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, and introducing a new part-time PGCE route that allows students to study while earning a salary.",
    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan's opinion on the pay dispute situation is that the Welsh Government is keeping a close eye on the situation and is aware of the concerns raised by the unions, particularly regarding the pay award for FE staff. She acknowledges that the employers' position is that they need an additional \u00a310.1 million to meet a pay award commensurate with schoolteachers, but she does not comment on whether the Welsh Government will take action to support the colleges in this regard. She emphasizes that the issue is being negotiated between the colleges and the employers, and that the Welsh Government will wait to see the outcome of the negotiations before responding formally.",
