The IDFC is authorized to mobilize private sector capital and skills for economic development in developing and transition countries, complementing U.S. development assistance and foreign policy objectives. The agency is a wholly owned government corporation under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State and is expected to play a major role in the U.S. government's development finance efforts.\n\nThe IDFC's mission is to promote private investment in support of U.S. global development goals and economic interests. The agency will have a broad range of authorities, including the power to make loans and guarantees, issue insurance or reinsurance, and take minority equity positions in investments. The IDFC will also conduct feasibility studies, provide technical assistance, and support special projects and programs.\n\nThe IDFC's operations will be guided by a performance measurement system that evaluates and monitors its projects and guides future project support. The agency will be required to report to Congress on its economic and social development impact, the extent to which its operations complement or are compatible with U.S. development assistance programs, and the compliance of projects with statutory requirements.\n\nThe IDFC will be funded through a Corporate Capital Account, with fees for services, interest earnings, and transfers of unexpended balances from predecessor agencies. The agency's annual appropriations will be designated by Congress, with the rest of the funds reverting to the Treasury.\n\nThe IDFC's decision to support projects will be guided by a range of factors, including the preference for U.S. sponsors, countries embracing private enterprise, worker rights, environmental and social impact, and international trade obligations. The agency will also have limitations on its support, including a prohibition on providing support to projects that are likely to have significant adverse environmental or social impacts, and a restriction on providing support to entities involved in boycotts or human rights violations.\n\nThe IDFC is expected to become operational in early 2019, replacing the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) development finance functions. The agency's operations will have implications for U.S. trade and investment promotion efforts, and Congress may consider issues related to the IDFC's implementation, including its ability to balance its development mandate with its role in promoting U.S. business interests.",
    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was established by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The law provided both program authority and funding for TANF through the end of FY2002. Since then, most legislative activity has focused on extending the program's funding and financing authority.\n\nThe AFDC program, which preceded TANF, was created in the 1930s to provide cash assistance to needy families with children. The program's purpose was to allow mothers to stay at home and care for their children. Over time, the program's focus shifted from providing cash to single mothers to promoting self-sufficiency and work.\n\nThe 1996 welfare reform law made significant changes to the AFDC program, including the creation of the TANF block grant. The law also established a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance, prohibited unwed minor parents from receiving cash assistance, and required states to implement work requirements for recipients.\n\nSince 1996, TANF has undergone several reauthorizations, including the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These laws have made changes to TANF's funding and financing authority, as well as its work requirements and funding formulas.\n\nTANF has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it has not been effective in promoting work and reducing poverty, while others argue that it has helped to reduce the number of families on welfare. The program has been the subject of numerous waivers and demonstrations, which have allowed states to experiment with different approaches to providing cash assistance and promoting work.\n\nOverall, the TANF block grant has played a significant role in shaping the US welfare system, and its future direction and funding will continue to be shaped by ongoing debates about its effectiveness and the needs of the families it serves.",

The Bureau of Reclamation, a part of the Department of the Interior, plays a crucial role in managing the basin's waters. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework for apportioning water between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the Lower Basin receiving 75% of the total allocation. The compact also established the role of the federal government in managing the river's waters.\n\nOver the years, various agreements and laws have been enacted to address the complex issues surrounding the Colorado River, including the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, the Arizona v. California decision in 1963, and the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. The Upper Basin Compact of 1948 allocated water rights among the Upper Basin states, while the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 authorized storage reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin.\n\nThe basin's water storage projects, including Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam, provide a significant portion of the region's water supply and generate hydropower. However, the basin's water levels have been declining due to drought and increased consumptive use, leading to concerns about the long-term sustainability of the water supply. The Colorado River Basin is also home to several endangered species, including the humpback chub and the razorback sucker, which are protected by federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn response to the drought and declining water levels, Congress has enacted the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan, which requires states to curtail water use and contribute to Lake Mead storage. The plan also includes provisions for voluntary conservation efforts and the development of new water storage projects. However, some stakeholders have raised concerns about the plan's impact on the environment and the potential for further degradation of the Salton Sea.\n\nThe report highlights the complex and interconnected nature of the Colorado River Basin's water management, involving multiple stakeholders, federal and state laws, and international agreements. It emphasizes the need for continued cooperation and planning to ensure the long-term sustainability of the basin's water supply and to protect the environment.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees. The FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity from certain types of tort claims, allowing plaintiffs to recover damages from the federal government. However, the FTCA also imposes significant limitations on the types of claims that can be brought and the amount of damages that can be recovered.\n\nThe FTCA only applies to torts committed by federal employees, and does not protect nonemployees from liability. The law excludes independent contractors from the definition of \"employee,\" and the government cannot be held liable for torts committed by its independent contractors.\n\nThe FTCA contains several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the intentional tort exception, and the foreign country exception. The discretionary function exception shields the government from liability for actions that involve the exercise of judgment or discretion, while the intentional tort exception preserves the government's immunity for certain types of intentional torts. The foreign country exception bars claims arising in a foreign country.\n\nThe FTCA also imposes procedural requirements, such as the requirement that plaintiffs exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit. The law sets a two-year time limit for filing a claim, and plaintiffs must submit a written notification of their claim to the relevant agency before filing a lawsuit.\n\nThere have been proposals to amend the FTCA, including abrogating or narrowing the Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for injuries to servicemen. Some have argued that the Feres doctrine creates unjust results and should be abolished or narrowed, while others argue that it is necessary to protect military discipline and effectiveness.\n\nIn addition to proposals to modify the FTCA, Congress can also enact private bills to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.",

The agency's projects are typically funded through individual project authorizations from Congress, and the funding is not guaranteed. The Bureau of Reclamation also provides funding for rural water supply projects through the Rural Water Supply Program, which was authorized in 2006. This program is administered by the Bureau of Reclamation and provides funding for water supply projects in rural areas.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service provides loans and grants for drinking water, sanitary sewer, and storm drainage facilities in rural communities. The agency's programs are administered at the national level and are allocated based on rural population, poverty, and unemployment. The USDA has funded over $13.9 billion for water supply and wastewater projects between 2009 and 2016.\n\nThe Department of Defense's USACE operates water resource projects throughout the country, with a focus on navigation, flood damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration.

The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 304 new ships, or an average of about 10 per year. The Navy's projected force levels under the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan show that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034, about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan.\n\nThe Navy's 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The goal is intended to provide the Navy with a more effective and efficient force structure, but the Navy's current shipbuilding plans may not match the composition called for in the FSA. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, but the mix of ships will not match the FSA mix.\n\nThe Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan is also facing challenges related to affordability. The plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, which are projected to require $7 billion per year in funding from the mid-2020s to the mid-2030s. This is a significant increase from the Navy's current shipbuilding budget, which is roughly $14 billion per year. The Navy's shipbuilding budget has grown in recent years, and the growing demand for shipbuilding work could lead to cost growth and challenges in meeting the Navy's shipbuilding goals.\n\nThe Navy's shipbuilding plans are also facing challenges related to the potential for cost growth on individual ship designs. The Navy's estimates of the cost of individual ship classes, such as the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier and the Virginia-class attack submarine, may be too low, and the actual cost of these ships could be higher than the Navy's estimates.

The program is administered by states under federal requirements and oversight of the Department of Labor's Office of Unemployment Insurance. States have flexibility in setting benefit amounts and duration, as well as eligibility requirements.\n\nThe program's funding comes primarily from state payroll taxes on employers, with administrative costs covered by a federal payroll tax. The Unemployment Trust Fund holds the funds, and the Department of Labor certifies administrative grants to states. States collect taxes and report results to the Department of the Treasury.\n\nIndividuals typically claim benefits by filing online or by phone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The average weekly benefit is about $350, and claimants usually remain on the program for 15 weeks.\n\nTo be eligible for benefits, individuals must actively search for work under federal law. States have varying work search requirements, but the federal law requires claimants to be \"actively seeking work.\" States define this requirement, and some specify a minimum number of weekly contacts with potential employers.\n\nThe Department of Labor uses its Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system to determine the accuracy of UI benefit payments and estimate improper payments. States review a random sample of cases weekly and reconstruct the UI claims process to assess accuracy. The BAM system reports results to the Department of Labor, which estimates improper payment rates and calculates a nationwide rate.\n\nThe leading cause of UI improper payments is overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. In fiscal year 2017, states made an estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments to such claimants. Other causes of improper payments include payments to individuals who continued to make claims after returning to work and payments to claimants who were determined ineligible due to disqualifying job separations.\n\nThe national work search overpayment rate increased from 2.4 percent in 2013 to 4.5 percent in 2017. State work search overpayment rates varied widely, ranging from 0 to 41 percent of UI benefits paid. States use various methods to recover overpayments, including setting up payment plans, offsetting UI benefits, or deducting refunds from federal or state income tax returns.\n\nSome states have implemented more stringent work search requirements, which may contribute to higher improper payment rates. DOL has identified strategies to address leading causes of UI improper payments, including providing states with tools and funding to improve work search activities and verifying claimant-reported job contacts.\n\nThe Department of Labor monitors states' work",

The Office of Capital Asset Management, Engineering, and Support provides funding for demolitions, while the Office of Construction and Facilities Management develops and updates policies and procedures for disposal actions. The Office of Asset Enterprise Management oversees the Strategic Capital Investment Planning process and ensures that local facility disposal requests align with VA policy.\n\nVA's disposal process involves several options, including reusing vacant and underutilized properties, demolishing buildings, entering into enhanced-use leases, and transferring properties to the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal. The agency conducts environmental and historic reviews to ensure that disposals comply with federal requirements.\n\nBetween fiscal years 2012 and 2017, VA disposed of 577 properties, primarily through demolition and enhanced-use lease agreements. The majority of these disposals were of offices, housing quarters, service buildings, and warehouses. However, more than a third of the vacant buildings designated as non-historic were demolished, and almost a third were disposed of using enhanced-use leases.\n\nVA officials and stakeholders have identified several challenges in managing and disposing of properties, including environmental and historic reviews, marketability of properties, and competing priorities for VA funds. The agency has taken steps to address these challenges, including establishing a working group to assist VISNs and local facilities with environmental and historic reviews and developing a toolkit to facilitate communication with stakeholders.\n\nHowever, VA lacks clear procedures for managing property disposals, and its current data collection system does not provide sufficient information to track and monitor the disposal of its vacant properties. The agency's Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) database does not collect data on disposal status information and time frames, making it difficult for VA officials to track the length of the disposal process and identify areas where management can assist in implementing property disposals.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs develop clear procedures for each disposal option, collect data on disposal status information and time frames, and increase the capacity of the CAI database to allow local facilities to upload disposal",

However, the report also identifies several areas for improvement, including the lack of consideration of operations and maintenance (O&M) costs in the design process.\n\nThe report found that GSA does not fully consider O&M costs when making design choices, which can lead to increased costs and decreased functionality. The agency's procedures for planning and designing new buildings do not require the estimation of O&M costs, and officials are not always consulted on O&M costs and issues during the design process. As a result, GSA may not be aware of the full impact of design choices on O&M costs and may not be able to identify opportunities to reduce costs.\n\nThe report also notes that GSA does not systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. This lack of information can make it difficult for the agency to identify best practices and make informed decisions about future design choices.\n\nTo address these issues, the report makes four recommendations to GSA: (1) update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process; (2) update existing procedures to require GSA officials to obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences of design choices at key decision points; (3) update existing procedures to require GSA officials to further consider and document how design choices may affect building functionality; and (4) update existing procedures to require GSA officials to systematically collect and share information on the positive and negative effects of common design choices on O&M costs in existing buildings.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the need for GSA to improve its approach to design and construction, with a greater emphasis on considering O&M costs and functionality in the planning and design process. By doing so, the agency can create buildings",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The report highlights the various uses and benefits of the Department of Defense's (DOD) excess controlled property (LESO) program for law enforcement agencies. The program allows federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to acquire excess DOD property, such as vehicles, equipment, and supplies, at no cost or at a reduced cost. The program has been used for a range of law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security operations, as well as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, and police training.\n\nThe report also notes that the program has helped agencies save money, with one local law enforcement agency in Texas reporting that 96% of its budget goes to salaries and that the LESO program helped the department acquire items it would otherwise not be able to afford, saving an estimated $2 million to $3 million. The program has also been used to support specialized operations, such as the use of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to rescue stranded people from floodwaters.\n\nHowever, the report also identifies weaknesses in the LESO program's processes for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that DLA's internal controls for these processes were not adequate, and that the program lacked a comprehensive framework for fraud prevention and mitigation. The GAO recommended that DLA revise its policy and procedures for verifying and approving applications, ensure compliance with requirements for transferring property, and conduct a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe DOD concurred with all of the GAO's recommendations, and has taken steps to address the identified weaknesses. The report concludes that the LESO program has the potential to provide significant benefits to law enforcement agencies, but that DLA must take steps to strengthen its internal controls and ensure the program is used effectively and efficiently.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a government agency responsible for reviewing foreign investments in the United States to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security. Established in 1975, CFIUS reviews transactions involving foreign persons acquiring U.S. companies, mergers, and acquisitions. The agency's primary goal is to determine whether a transaction may impair national security and, if so, whether it should be allowed to proceed.\n\nThe CFIUS process involves several stages, including pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. The agency reviews transactions on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors that may impact national security, such as the potential for foreign control of U.S. businesses, the transfer of critical technologies, and the potential for transshipment or diversion of military technologies.\n\nIn recent years, CFIUS has experienced an increase in workload, with the number of covered transactions reviewed growing from 111 in 2011 to 172 in 2016, a 55% increase. The complexity of reviews has also increased, with more transactions involving emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics. CFIUS staff have reported that the rise in complexity requires additional time and staff to address.\n\nDespite the increase in workload, CFIUS has generally been able to review transactions within the required timeframe. However, some stakeholders have expressed concerns about the agency's ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures. The lack of centralized budgeting and coordination among member agencies has also been identified as a challenge.\n\nThe report concludes that CFIUS faces challenges in addressing its workload, particularly in identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures. To address these challenges, the report recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury coordinate with member agencies to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload. This would facilitate a better understanding of the committee's objectives and ensure that CFIUS can fulfill its responsibilities to address threats to national security.",
