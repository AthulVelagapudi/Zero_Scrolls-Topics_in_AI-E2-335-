However, the reviewer notes that the movie eventually finds its rhythm and point, and that the first hour is \"lame\" but sets the stage for the rest of the film. The tone of the beginning is more chaotic and disorganized, but not necessarily boring or sad.",

The Arzians, despite being a seemingly primitive species, have a complex society with their own culture, language, and way of life. The pink fishers are not just simple prey, but are actually a part of the octopod's culture, and are deliberately used for entertainment. This shows that the octopods are not just mindless monsters, but have their own sophisticated culture and society. The story emphasizes the need for caution and care when interacting with other species, and the importance of understanding their perspectives and customs."
