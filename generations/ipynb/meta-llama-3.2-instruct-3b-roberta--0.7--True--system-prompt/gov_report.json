The law replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with a new block grant program, which provided funding to states for cash assistance to needy families. The law also introduced a time limit of five years for receiving cash assistance, and states were given more flexibility to design their own programs and set their own work requirements.\n\nThe law also included provisions to promote work and self-sufficiency among recipients, such as the creation of the Work Incentive Program (WIN) and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program. Additionally, the law introduced a new block grant program, the Welfare-Work grant program, which provided funding for states to implement work-based programs.\n\nThe law also included provisions to reduce the role of the federal government in administering welfare programs, and to increase the role of states in designing and implementing their own programs. The law also introduced a new requirement that states verify work activities of recipients and require them to participate in work-related activities.\n\nThe law was amended several times since its enactment, including the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These amendments made changes to the law's provisions, including the extension of the TANF block grant, the reduction of the work requirement, and the introduction of new funding for work-based programs.\n\nThe TANF block grant has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it has led to a decline in the number of people receiving cash assistance and an increase in poverty and inequality. Others argue that the law has promoted work and self-sufficiency among recipients, and has helped to reduce the role of the federal government in administering welfare programs.\n\nOverall, the TANF block grant has had a significant impact on the welfare system in the United States, and its provisions continue to shape the way that states design and implement their own welfare programs today.",

    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to file lawsuits against the United States government for damages resulting from tortious conduct by federal employees or certain government activities. The law was enacted in 1946 to provide a mechanism for citizens to seek compensation for injuries caused by the government's negligence or wrongdoing.\n\nThe FTCA waives the government's sovereign immunity, allowing plaintiffs to sue the government for damages in federal court. However, the law also imposes certain limitations and exceptions to this waiver of immunity. For example, the government is immune from liability for discretionary functions, such as those involving policy judgments or decisions, and for certain types of claims, such as those related to military activities.\n\nThe FTCA also has a statute of limitations, which requires plaintiffs to file their claims within two years of the incident. Additionally, the law requires plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in federal court. If the government denies a claim, plaintiffs have six months to file a lawsuit in federal court.\n\nThere have been proposals to amend the FTCA to modify its standards, including abrogating the Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for injuries to servicemen. Some lawmakers have also proposed private bills to compensate individuals who are unable to obtain recourse under the FTCA.\n\nThe FTCA serves two primary functions: to deter tortious conduct by government employees and to compensate victims of government wrongdoing. However, the law has been criticized for its limitations and exceptions, which can make it difficult for victims to obtain justice. Despite these challenges, the FTCA remains an important tool for holding the government accountable for its actions and providing compensation to those who have been injured by its negligence or wrongdoing.",

The committee reviews transactions involving foreign persons, including foreign governments, and determines whether they pose a national security risk to the United States.\n\nThe report highlights the increasing workload of CFIUS, with the number of transactions reviewed increasing from 172 in 2011 to 238 in 2017. The report also notes that the complexity of transactions has increased, with many involving emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics. The committee has experienced staffing challenges, with some officials stating that they do not have the necessary resources to complete their reviews in a timely manner.\n\nThe report also notes that CFIUS has identified non-notified transactions, which are transactions that are not voluntarily submitted to the committee for review. These transactions pose a higher risk to national security, and the committee is working to improve its ability to review them.\n\nThe report concludes that CFIUS plays a crucial role in protecting national security, but that the committee's workload and staffing challenges pose a risk to its ability to effectively review transactions. The report makes several recommendations, including increasing the number of staff and improving the committee's coordination with other agencies.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of CFIUS in promoting foreign investment and creating jobs in the United States. The report notes that foreign investment is essential to the U.S. economy, but that CFIUS must balance the need to protect national security with the need to facilitate foreign investment.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of CFIUS and its role in protecting national security through the review of foreign acquisitions. It highlights the challenges faced by the committee and makes recommendations for improving its ability to effectively review transactions and promote foreign investment in the United States.",

    "gao_GAO-18-403": "The report highlights the challenges faced by collegiate aviation schools in producing professional pilots. The majority of schools (10 out of 18) cited recruiting and retaining flight instructors as a moderate to great challenge. The main reasons for this challenge include the high cost of flight training, limited availability of qualified instructors, and the need for instructors to accrue a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time to become certified. \n\nThe report also notes that the cost of flight training is a significant barrier for many students, with some schools charging up to $81,000 for a 4-year program. Additionally, the report found that the number of flight instructors is limited, with only 86 schools holding R-ATP certificates as of 2016.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of pilot training and the need for the aviation industry to address the shortage of qualified pilots. The FAA estimates that there will be a shortage of 2,000 to 3,000 pilots by 2021. \n\nThe report also notes that the industry is taking steps to address the shortage, including offering cadet programs and incentives to retain flight instructors. However, more needs to be done to address the issue, particularly in terms of increasing funding for pilot training programs and providing more support for students who are pursuing a career in aviation.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that the collegiate aviation industry faces significant challenges in producing professional pilots, but that with the right support and resources, it is possible to address these challenges and ensure a sustainable supply of qualified pilots."
