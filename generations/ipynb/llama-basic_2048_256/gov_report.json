    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States government for certain torts, or wrongful acts, committed by federal employees or officers while acting within the scope of their employment. The FTCA serves two main purposes: to deter people from committing torts and to compensate those who are injured by the government's wrongful actions.\n\nThe FTCA was enacted in 1946 to address the issue of sovereign immunity, which previously prohibited private citizens from suing the government for torts. The law allows individuals to sue the government for certain types of torts, including personal injury, property damage, and wrongful death, but excludes certain types of claims, such as those arising from military service.\n\nThe FTCA has undergone significant changes over the years, including the introduction of the Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for certain types of injuries sustained by military personnel. The doctrine was established in 1950 and has been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\nIn recent years, there have been proposals to modify or abolish the Feres doctrine, with some arguing that it unfairly bars military personnel from seeking compensation for injuries sustained during their service. Others argue that the doctrine is necessary to maintain military discipline and effectiveness.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of numerous court cases and legislative proposals, with some arguing that it should be expanded to cover more types of claims and others arguing that it should be narrowed to exclude certain types of claims. The law has been amended several times, including the passage of the Sfc. Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019, which would allow certain military personnel to bring claims against the government for damages arising from medical malpractice.\n\nOverall, the FTCA plays an important role in providing recourse for individuals who have been injured by the government's wrongful actions, and its provisions continue to be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion.",

The strategy identifies reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife as a top priority, with a focus on raising public awareness and changing consumer behavior.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* The United States is a significant market for illegally traded wildlife products, with major markets in Asia, particularly China, Vietnam, and Thailand.\n* The U.S. government agencies, including the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), are working together to combat wildlife trafficking.\n* The DOI's Law Enforcement Management Information System shows that the number of seizures of wildlife products has increased over the past decade, but the data may not reflect the true extent of the problem.\n* The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has identified several programs that have contributed to combating wildlife trafficking, but more needs to be done to assess their effectiveness.\n* USAID has implemented several programs to reduce demand for wildlife products, including awareness-raising campaigns and education programs for consumers.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* The U.S. government should continue to prioritize reducing demand for illegally traded wildlife products and support programs that raise public awareness and change consumer behavior.\n* The DOI should improve the accuracy and reliability of its seizure data to better understand the scope of the problem.\n* The Department of State should conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its programs to assess their effectiveness in combating wildlife trafficking.\n* USAID should continue to support programs that reduce demand for wildlife products and promote sustainable livelihoods for communities that are affected by wildlife trafficking.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking and Reducing Demand is a crucial step towards reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife products in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government agencies are making progress in combating wildlife trafficking, but more needs to be done to address the scope of the problem. By prioritizing reducing demand and supporting effective programs, the U.S. government can make a significant impact in protecting endangered species and promoting sustainable development.",

The report is divided into several sections, including background, methodology, and findings.\n\nBackground:\nThe report begins by explaining that civil aviation in the US can be divided into two categories: general aviation and commercial aviation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates the safety of civil aviation in the US, including pilot certification and training. The report notes that pilot training requirements are found in the Federal Aviation Regulations, and that these regulations prescribe the minimum training, knowledge, and experience requirements for acquiring a private, commercial, or airline transport pilot certificate.\n\nMethodology:\nThe report describes the methodology used to gather data and conduct the audit. The audit was conducted from September 2016 to May 2018, and involved reviewing documents, interviewing stakeholders, and administering a standardized question set to a non-generalizable sample of 18 collegiate aviation schools. The report also analyzed data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems.\n\nFindings:\nThe report highlights several key findings, including:\n\n* The majority of collegiate aviation schools have professional pilot degree programs, with 147 schools identified in the IPEDS database.\n* The majority of schools have 4-year baccalaureate degree programs, but some offer 2-year associate's degree programs.\n* The majority of schools have in-state tuition and fees, but some offer out-of-state tuition and fees.\n* The majority of schools reported that the most challenging factors to their ability to produce pilots are:\n\t+ Availability of qualified instructors (cited by 14 schools as a great or moderate challenge)\n\t+ Cost of training (cited by 13 schools as a great or moderate challenge)\n\t+ Availability of funding (cited by 12 schools as a great or moderate challenge)\n\t+ Regulatory requirements (cited by 11 schools as a great or moderate challenge)\n\t+ Availability of resources (cited by 10 schools as a great or moderate challenge)\n* The report also notes that some schools have implemented innovative programs to address these challenges, such as online training programs and partnerships with industry partners.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the collegiate aviation industry in the US, highlighting the challenges faced by these schools and potential solutions to address these challenges."
