    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer did not disagree with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control. In fact, the conversation did not mention any disagreement about the shape of the remote control. The discussion was about the design of the remote control, including the use of rubber buttons, a non-remote design, and the inclusion of voice recognition and menu options. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface were working together to come up with a design concept, and there was no indication of disagreement between them.",
    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components in the meeting transcript revolves around the design of a new remote control. The team considers two main industrial components: titanium and spongy (rubber). They explore the possibility of using titanium for the outer shell, which could be shaped like a fruit, and spongy for the inner components. The team also discusses the importance of user-friendliness and the need for a simple and intuitive design. They decide to keep the L_C_D_ (likely a reference to the layout of the buttons and controls) and stick with classical design elements, such as two batteries, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. The team also considers the trend of people changing their TV remotes more often than batteries, which suggests that the design should prioritize ease of use and changeability.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that people tend to change their TV more often than their remote controls, and that the trend of having a remote control with advanced features is moving faster than the life of the remote control itself.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion about appearance design revolves around the conceptual design of a new remote control. The team considers two main options: a titanium design that smells like fruit and a spongy design. They explore the possibility of combining both designs, with a titanium body and spongy panels. The team also discusses the importance of user-friendliness and the need for a simple and intuitive interface. They decide to stick with a classical design, avoiding reinventing the wheel, and consider the trend of frequent changes to TV sets, which makes battery replacement less of a concern. The team concludes that the design should be easy to use and visually appealing, with a focus on a simple and recognizable shape.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a productive and efficient session where the team discussed the final design of a remote control. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype, and the team provided feedback and suggestions. The Project Manager discussed the evaluation criteria and finance, and the Marketing team provided input on the design. The team worked well together, with the User Interface expressing satisfaction with the leadership and the overall process. The meeting was completed within the allocated time, and the team was able to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary. The project was deemed a success, with costs within budget and no major issues encountered. The team was able to draw on the whiteboard, but unfortunately, the animal design was not pink as requested.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer, which provides 48 weeks of free childcare for 3-4 year olds from low-income families. The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, and officials from the Welsh Government presented the offer and answered questions from committee members. The committee discussed various aspects of the offer, including its impact on work participation, poverty, and income levels, as well as its integration with the UK Government's tax-free childcare offer. The committee also raised concerns about the complexity of the offer and the need for better communication with parents and providers. The meeting concluded with the committee resolving to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.",

    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, did not explicitly state her opinion on the pay dispute situation in the provided transcript. However, she acknowledged that Coleg Cymru's position is that an additional 3.5% or \u00a310.1 million is needed to meet a pay award commensurate with schoolteachers, and she stated that her department is aware of the situation and will wait to see the outcome of the negotiations.",
    "va-sq-125": "There is no mention of perinatal mental health service or long-term special care for pregnant women in the provided transcript.",
    "va-sq-145": "The product manager wants to achieve the expected profit by making the remote control trendy and by offering different colored fronts for the remote control, which can be sold separately, allowing the company to make extra profit.",
    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed the progress on the TORRENT chip project. Professor B mentioned that they were two months away from being done with the project two years ago, but they had not made significant progress since then. PhD A asked about the project, and Professor B explained that they had been working on it for two years but had not made much progress. The team discussed various methods for improving the project, including using VTS (Voice Transformation System) and applying on-line normalization. They also talked about the pros and cons of different methods and how they might be combined. The meeting concluded with a decision to read some digits and continue discussing the project.",
    "va-sq-179": "There is no mention of Marketing discussing market trend findings in the provided transcript.",
    "va-sq-184": "The government's plan towards the structural change was to place funding back into the sector in innovation funding, with a specific aim of \u00a315 million in 2020-21 to improve universities' ability to access funding from outside Wales, as recommended by the Reid review.",
    "va-sq-186": "There is no mention of \"risk appetite\" in the provided transcript.",
    "va-sq-216": "The Industrial Designer did not explicitly discuss appearance design in the given transcript. The conversation focused on the functionality and features of the remote control, such as the number of buttons, the placement of buttons, and the possibility of a screen or other interactive elements.",
    "va-sq-219": "The target price of the remote control is 25 Euros, the target cost is 12.5 Euros, and the target profit is 50 million Euros.",
    "va-sq-225": "The transcript does not provide specific information about the microphone data. However, it does mention that the transcribers will discuss the data and make observations, and that there is a focus on presegmentation and modifications to the multitrack interface to improve the encoding of overlapping segments. Additionally, there is a mention of using echo cancellation to handle periods of overlapping talk, but this is not related to the microphone data itself.",
    "va-sq-250": "There is no mention of the Prime Minister saying anything about students in the provided transcript.",
    "va-sq-258": "The professor didn't explicitly state their thoughts about positional parameters, but they mentioned that the number of Gaussians per state might be a limitation in the system, and that having fewer states could make the system simpler and more computationally efficient.",
    "va-sq-264": "The decision on the remote feature design is not explicitly stated in the provided transcript. However, the designers discuss various ideas and considerations for the remote control, including:\n\n* Making it user-friendly and easy to use\n* Having a simple and intuitive design\n* Using big buttons instead of small ones\n* Including an LED on the corner to indicate that it's working\n* Keeping the design lightweight and not too heavy\n* Using a material that is not too expensive\n* Making it compatible with other devices\n* Reducing battery usage to minimize the need for frequent battery changes\n\nThe designers also mention that the remote control should be able to control multiple functions, such as channels and volume, and that it should have a distinctive design that makes it easy to identify. However, no final decision is made on the specific design or features of the remote control."
