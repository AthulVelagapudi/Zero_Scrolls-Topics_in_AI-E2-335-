The sentences were generated using eleven sentence templates, each with a specific emotion and gender association, and were instantiated with pre-chosen values. The sentences were then manually examined and derived in pairs, with each pair consisting of a sentence with a female noun phrase and a sentence with a male noun phrase. The sentences were also compared to a gold standard dataset, and the results showed significant differences in sentiment intensity predictions between male and female noun phrases.",
