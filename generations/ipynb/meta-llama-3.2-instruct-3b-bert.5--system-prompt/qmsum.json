    "va-gq-93": "The meeting was about the childcare policy in Wales, specifically the Universal Childcare Offer (UCO) and the proposed 30 hours of free childcare for all children from the age of 3 to 4. The Minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, presented the Welsh Government's plan to implement the UCO, which aims to support working parents with childcare costs. The committee discussed various aspects of the proposal, including the potential impact on the workforce, the cost of implementing the scheme, and the need for clarity on the eligibility criteria and the administrative burden on local authorities.\n\nThe committee raised concerns about the complexity of the scheme, the potential for unequal treatment of families, and the need for a more detailed evaluation of the impact on disadvantaged families. They also discussed the need for a phased rollout, with a focus on areas with high demand and limited childcare provision.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged the concerns and assured the committee that the Welsh Government is committed to making the scheme work. He mentioned that the UCO is not just about providing childcare, but also about supporting working parents to balance work and family responsibilities. The Minister also highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach to addressing poverty and inequality, and the importance of working with local authorities, childcare providers, and other stakeholders to ensure the success of the scheme.\n\nOverall, the meeting was focused on finding ways to make the Universal Childcare Offer a success, while addressing the challenges and complexities associated with implementing a new policy.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that there is a trend of filling 300 priority places for secondary school teachers, but recruiting to 65% of targets. She attributed this to the fact that the recruitment process is not just about money, and that research shows that financial incentives alone are not enough to attract people into teaching. She mentioned that a 40% drop in students from the US has been observed in other countries, and that the issue is not unique to Wales. Kirsty Williams also mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, including introducing a new ITE recruitment marketing exercise, and that the government is working with ITE centres to develop a more effective approach to teacher recruitment and retention.",
