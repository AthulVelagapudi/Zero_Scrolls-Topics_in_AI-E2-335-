It provides loans, guarantees, insurance, and investments in support of U.S. foreign policy objectives, with a focus on low-income and middle-income countries.\n\nThe IDFC's authorization includes provisions to support small businesses, women's economic empowerment, and worker rights. It also includes measures to prevent market distortion, corruption, and human rights violations. The IDFC's performance is to be measured and reported to Congress, and it is required to submit an annual report on its economic and social development impact.\n\nThe IDFC's reorganization plan was submitted to Congress in early 2019, and it is expected to be operational by October 1, 2019. The plan includes the transfer of functions from USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and it is expected to create a new entity that will support U.S. trade investment and development finance.\n\nThe IDFC's establishment is seen as a response to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and it is expected to compete with China in the development finance space. The U.S. government has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and environmental and social safeguards in China's development finance practices, and the IDFC is seen as a way to promote a more transparent and sustainable approach to development finance.\n\nOverall, the IDFC is expected to play a key role in promoting U.S. development finance and supporting economic growth in developing countries.",

The program replaced the AFDC program and aimed to promote work and self-sufficiency among low-income families. The TANF block grant program provides funding to states to support programs that promote work, family stability, and economic self-sufficiency.\n\nPrior to TANF, the AFDC program provided cash assistance to needy families, with a focus on supporting single mothers and children. However, the program was criticized for its limited work requirements and lack of incentives for employment. The TANF program shifted the focus from cash assistance to block grants, which allowed states to design and implement their own programs to promote work and self-sufficiency.\n\nThe TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception. In 2002, the program was reauthorized, and funding was increased to support states in implementing work requirements and promoting economic self-sufficiency. The program also expanded to include new initiatives, such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the Healthy Marriage Initiative.\n\nIn 2005, the Deficit Reduction Act extended TANF funding and provided additional funding for the program. The program has also been subject to various changes and amendments, including the 2012 TANF Extension Act, which extended funding and provided additional funding for the program.\n\nThe TANF program has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some critics arguing that it has not been effective in promoting work and self-sufficiency among low-income families. Others have argued that the program has been too restrictive and has not provided adequate support for low-income families.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the TANF program remains a critical component of the social safety net in the United States, providing funding to states to support programs that promote work, family stability, and economic self-sufficiency.

The river flows through the basin and is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency responsible for water storage, conveyance, and management facilities. The basin's water supply is primarily used for irrigation, industrial, and municipal purposes, with a significant portion allocated for fish and wildlife conservation.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact, signed in 1928, established a framework for water allocation between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the Upper Basin delivering 7.5 million acre-feet annually to the Lower Basin. The compact has undergone several revisions, including the 1968 Central Arizona Project Act, which authorized the construction of new water storage facilities and increased the annual allocation to the Lower Basin.\n\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate drought conditions in the basin, with warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns leading to reduced flows. The Bureau of Reclamation has implemented various measures to mitigate these impacts, including the Colorado River Storage Project, which provides water storage and hydroelectric power generation.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin is also home to numerous endangered species, including the razorback sucker and the humpback chub. The Bureau of Reclamation has implemented conservation efforts, such as the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, to protect these species and their habitats.\n\nIn recent years, the basin has faced significant drought conditions, with the Colorado River reaching record low levels in Lake Mead. In response, the Bureau of Reclamation has implemented drought contingency plans, including the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan, to reduce water use and conserve storage levels.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin is also home to several Native American reservations, including the Navajo Nation and the Jicarilla Apache Nation. The Bureau of Reclamation has worked with these tribes to develop water settlements and infrastructure projects, such as the Navajo - Gallup Water Supply Project.\n\nOverall, the Colorado River Basin is a complex and dynamic system that requires careful management to ensure the long-term sustainability of its water resources. The Bureau of Reclamation plays a critical role in managing the basin's water supply, and its efforts to conserve water and protect endangered species are essential to maintaining the health of the basin's ecosystem.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows civilians to sue the US government for certain types of injuries or damages that are caused by the government's negligence or wrongful actions. The law serves two main purposes: to deter government employees from committing tortious conduct and to provide compensation to victims of government wrongdoing.\n\nThe FTCA waives the government's sovereign immunity, allowing plaintiffs to sue for damages in federal court. However, the law has limitations and exceptions, including the discretionary function exception, which shields government employees from liability for actions taken within the scope of their employment.\n\nThe FTCA also has a statute of limitations, which requires plaintiffs to file their claims within two years of the incident. Additionally, the law requires plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in federal court.\n\nThe FTCA has been amended several times since its enactment in 1946, with some changes aimed at broadening the law's scope and others aimed at limiting its application. The law has been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that it provides too little compensation to victims and others arguing that it creates an unfair burden on the government.\n\nThe FTCA has been used in a variety of cases, including those involving military personnel, law enforcement officers, and government contractors. The law has also been the subject of several court decisions, including the Supreme Court's decision in Feres v. United States, which established the discretionary function exception.\n\nOverall, the FTCA is an important tool for holding the government accountable for its actions and providing compensation to victims of government wrongdoing. However, its limitations and exceptions can make it difficult for plaintiffs to recover damages, and its application can be influenced by a range of factors, including the discretion of government officials and the availability of alternative remedies.",
