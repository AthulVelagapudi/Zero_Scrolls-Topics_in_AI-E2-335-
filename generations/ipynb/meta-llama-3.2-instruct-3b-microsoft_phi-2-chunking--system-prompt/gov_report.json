The IDFC's mission is to complement U.S. development assistance objectives and foreign policy interests by providing financing, guarantees, and other forms of support to private sector investments in developing countries.\n\nThe IDFC's enabling legislation, the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), authorizes the corporation to make loans, guarantees, and equity investments in private sector projects in developing countries. The IDFC's authorities are designed to be more flexible and effective than those of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which is being phased out.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be guided by a performance measurement system that tracks development impact and ensures that support is additional to private sector resources. The corporation will have a Chief Development Officer and a Chief Risk Officer to oversee its operations and ensure that risks are managed effectively.\n\nThe IDFC's operations will be overseen by a Board of Directors, which includes representatives from the U.S. government, the private sector, and civil society. The corporation will have a transparent and independent accountability mechanism to ensure compliance with environmental, social, and labor standards.\n\nThe IDFC's activities will be subject to congressional oversight and reporting requirements, including annual reports to Congress on its economic and social development impact. The corporation will also be required to maintain a user-friendly, publicly available database with detailed project-level information.\n\nThe IDFC's establishment is seen as a response to China's growing economic influence in developing countries, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The U.S. government hopes that the IDFC will provide an alternative to state-directed investments and promote market-based private sector development in developing countries.\n\nThe IDFC's operations will be subject to certain limitations, including a prohibition on providing support to projects that are likely to have significant adverse environmental or social impacts without proper mitigation measures. The corporation will also be required to consider the impact of its support on women's economic opportunities and outcomes.\n\nThe IDFC's implementation will be guided by a reorganization plan that will be submitted to Congress, which will outline the procedures for the transfer of functions from OPIC and USAID to the IDFC.

The TANF block grant was designed to provide a flexible and block-granted funding source for states to implement welfare reform initiatives.\n\nThe TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) raised the cap on the percentage of TANF funds that could be used for child care, and established the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) grant program.

The basin spans over 246,000 square miles and flows through seven states in the US and Mexico, with the Bureau of Reclamation playing a key role in its management. The river's water is used for irrigation, industrial, and municipal purposes, and its hydropower facilities generate significant amounts of electricity.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922 established the framework for water apportionment between the Upper and Lower Basins, with the Lower Basin receiving a larger share of the water. The compact was modified by the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, which authorized the construction of major water storage and conveyance facilities, including the Hoover Dam.\n\nOver the years, the Colorado River has faced significant droughts, including the current drought, which has led to concerns about the river's sustainability. The 2012 Reclamation Study projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand in the basin, with flows decreasing by an average of 9% and demand increasing by 64-76%. To address this, Congress has approved several drought contingency plans, including the Upper Basin DCP and the Lower Basin DCP, which aim to reduce consumptive use and increase storage in Lake Mead.\n\nThe Lower Basin DCP, in particular, requires Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and contribute to Lake Mead storage, while also incentivizing voluntary conservation of water. However, some have raised concerns about the implementation of these plans, citing potential impacts on the Salton Sea and environmental laws.\n\nCongress has also been involved in funding and oversight of existing facilities and programs, including the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program and the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Program. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to develop new and augmented water storage infrastructure, including the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project and the proposed Navajo Nation Water Settlement in Utah.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin is a complex and dynamic system that requires careful management to ensure its long-term sustainability. The federal government, along with the states and other stakeholders, must work together to address the challenges posed by drought, climate change, and other factors to ensure the continued health of the river and its ecosystems.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States government for certain torts, or wrongful acts, committed by federal employees or while engaging in certain activities on federal property. The FTCA was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries or damages caused by the government's negligence or misconduct.\n\nThe FTCA waives the government's sovereign immunity, which previously protected the government from lawsuits, allowing individuals to bring tort claims against the United States. The law applies to claims arising from the negligent or wrongful acts of federal employees, including those committed while acting within the scope of their employment. However, the FTCA does not waive the government's immunity from claims that are deemed discretionary, intentional, or that fall under certain exceptions.\n\nThe FTCA provides several exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity, including the discretionary function exception, the intentional tort exception, and the foreign country exception. The discretionary function exception shields the government from liability for actions that involve policy-making or decision-making, while the intentional tort exception excludes certain types of intentional acts, such as assault and battery. The foreign country exception bars claims arising from injuries sustained in foreign countries.\n\nThe FTCA also imposes procedural requirements, including a requirement for plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit. The law sets a six-month deadline for filing a claim, and plaintiffs may seek relief from this deadline if they can demonstrate \"intervening facts\" or \"newly discovered evidence\" that warrant a larger award.\n\nThe FTCA has been the subject of legislative proposals to amend or modify its provisions. Some have advocated for broadening the waiver of sovereign immunity to include certain categories of claims or plaintiffs, while others have suggested narrowing the law to reduce the government's exposure to liability. The Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for injuries sustained during military service, has been a particular focus of debate.\n\nIn recent years, Congress has introduced bills to modify the Feres doctrine, allowing servicemembers to bring claims against the United States for certain types of injuries. Private bills have also been proposed to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse under the FTCA.\n\nOverall, the FTCA provides a means for individuals to seek compensation for injuries or damages caused by the government's negligence or misconduct, while also ensuring that the government is not exposed to excessive liability for its actions.",

Without using available data to identify why differences in violations appear to exist between DOD's two types of public water systems, DOD will likely be hampered in its ability to identify what actions, if any, could be taken to address any differences and improve overall compliance with health-based drinking water regulations.\n\nIn addition, our review found that DOD has taken steps to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including PFOS and PFOA. DOD has restricted the use of existing foams that contain PFCs, tested its current foams to identify the amount of PFCs they contain, and funded research into the future development of PFC-free foams that can meet DOD's performance and compatibility requirements.\n\nWe also found that DOD has responded to EPA and state orders to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA contamination in drinking water at or near military installations. DOD has taken steps to test for and address PFOS and PFOA in drinking water on 11 military installations, and has initiated actions to address PFOS and PFOA in drinking water for people living outside DOD installations.\n\nOverall, our review found that while DOD has made efforts to address health and environmental concerns with its use of PFCs and PFOS, PFO",
    "gao_GAO-18-420": "The General Services Administration's (GSA) Design Excellence Program has resulted in the construction of 78 federal buildings that are considered to be among the best in the country. These buildings have been designed to meet the functional needs of their tenants while also being aesthetically pleasing and serving as public landmarks. However, a review of these buildings has revealed that some design choices made during the planning and design stage have resulted in increased operational and maintenance (O&M) costs.\n\nAccording to the report, GSA has made choices that have decreased O&M costs, such as incorporating natural light into building design, using durable and low-maintenance materials, and selecting materials that are easy to clean. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles, California, features a light well and serrated glass fa\u00e7ade that maximizes natural light, reducing energy costs and the need for frequent lighting replacements.\n\nOn the other hand, some design choices have increased O&M costs, such as the use of multistory atriums and custom windows. Building managers and tenants reported that these features have resulted in increased costs due to the challenges associated with heating and cooling, making repairs, and cleaning these spaces. For example, the Albert Armendariz, Sr., U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, Texas, features a three-story window wall and front atrium that provide ample natural light, but also require expensive scaffolding and mechanical lifts to maintain.\n\nThe report also highlights that GSA does not fully consider O&M and functionality effects when making design choices. GSA officials estimated that only about one-third of O&M costs are accounted for during the planning and design stage, with the remaining two-thirds estimated later in the construction process. This lack of consideration can lead to costly design changes and may result in buildings that are not optimized for O&M costs.\n\nFurthermore, the report notes that GSA does not systematically collect and share information on the positive and negative effects of design choices on O&M costs in existing buildings. This lack of information can make it difficult for GSA to identify best practices and make informed decisions when designing new buildings.\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to GSA, including updating procedures to require GSA officials to estimate full O&M costs during the planning and design process, obtaining information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences of design choices, and systematically collecting and sharing information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the need for GSA to improve its approach to design and construction, taking into account the potential impact on O",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense's (DOD) Excess Controlled Property (LESO) program has been used by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to acquire essential items such as vehicles, equipment, and supplies that would otherwise be unaffordable. The program has been instrumental in enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review found significant weaknesses in the program's internal controls, including inadequate verification and approval processes for federal agency applications and the transfer of controlled property.\n\nThe GAO's review identified several areas of concern, including the lack of a comprehensive framework for fraud prevention and mitigation measures. The agency found that DOD's LESO program has not conducted a fraud risk assessment, and its internal controls did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud. The GAO made four recommendations to DOD to address these weaknesses, including revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with on-site officials' verification of valid identification and authorization, issuing guidance for verifying the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred, and conducting a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.\n\nThe GAO's findings and recommendations are significant, as they highlight the need for DOD to strengthen its internal controls and ensure the integrity of the LESO program. The program's effectiveness in supporting law enforcement agencies is compromised by the lack of robust internal controls, which can lead to potential fraud and misappropriation of funds. DOD's response to the GAO's recommendations is crucial to addressing these weaknesses and ensuring the program's integrity.",

The agency was established in 1975 and is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. CFIUS reviews transactions involving a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, technology, and finance.\n\nIn recent years, CFIUS has reviewed over 170 transactions, with the majority coming from the manufacturing sector. The committee's workload has increased significantly, with a 55% increase in transactions reviewed between 2011 and 2016. The complexity of these transactions has also increased, with many involving new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nCFIUS has a four-stage review process, which includes pre-notice consultation, national security review, national security investigation, and presidential action. The committee reviews transactions individually, with a focus on the aspects that could pose a risk to national security. If CFIUS determines that a transaction poses a risk, it may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the transaction.\n\nThe committee's workload has been affected by the increasing complexity of transactions and the growing number of transactions reviewed. Staffing levels have not kept pace with the increase in workload, with many agencies expressing concerns about their ability to complete core functions such as monitoring mitigation measures and identifying non-notified transactions.\n\nThe CFIUS process has been the subject of several congressional bills, which could increase the committee's workload. Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget have begun to collect data on staffing levels, but the committee does not have a centralized budget, and Treasury does not have authority over staffing levels at member agencies.\n\nStakeholders have expressed concerns about the potential impact of changes to the CFIUS process, including altering the structure of the committee, redefining which transactions should be reviewed, and expanding the list of factors considered. The committee's effectiveness and workload are critical to ensuring the national security of the United States, and it is essential that the committee's staffing levels and processes are adequate to address these challenges.\n\nIn summary, CFIUS plays a critical role in reviewing foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies to determine whether they pose a threat to national security. The committee's workload has increased significantly in recent years, and staffing levels have not kept pace with the increase. The committee's effectiveness and workload are critical to ensuring the national security of the United States, and it is essential that the committee's staffing levels and processes are adequate to address",
