    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed the progress of the Aurora speech recognition system. The system was trained on the TI-digit dataset and tested on the Meeting Recorder digits dataset. The meeting focused on the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) problem, which is a common issue in speech recognition systems. The VAD system was not performing well on certain noises, such as background noise and low-energy speech components. The meeting also discussed the use of spectral subtraction, which was found to be effective in removing noise but may degrade speech. A Wiener filter was also tested, which showed promise in smoothing the noise spectrum. The meeting touched on the use of VTS (Variable Transformation of Speech) in the cepstral domain, which was found to be dependent on the level of the speech signal. The meeting concluded that a combination of methods may be necessary to improve the performance of the system.",
