Back-Translation (BT): This involves translating monolingual target texts into the source language to generate artificial parallel data.\n2. Copying: This involves copying target sentences to generate artificial parallel data.\n3. Copy-marking: This involves augmenting the source vocabulary with a copy of the target vocabulary, marked with a special language identifier.\n4. Dummy tokens: This involves replacing words with dummy tokens to generate artificial parallel data.\n5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): This involves using a generator to encode pseudo-source sentences and a discriminator to distinguish between natural and artificial sources.\n6. Target Language Model (LM) integration: This involves using a target LM to generate additional input to the decoder, and fine-tuning the model on in-domain data.",
