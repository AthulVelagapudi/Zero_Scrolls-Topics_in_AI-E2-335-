The 1996 law provided funding for TANF through FY2002 and made significant changes to the program, including the requirement that states implement work requirements for recipients. Since then, most legislative activity has focused on extending TANF funding and making minor policy changes.\n\nThe AFDC program, which preceded TANF, was created in 1935 and provided cash assistance to needy families with children. The program was later renamed AFDC and underwent several changes, including the addition of new programs such as child support enforcement and social services. The welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s focused on issues of work and marriage, with some arguing that providing cash assistance to single mothers discouraged work and marriage.\n\nThe 1996 welfare reform law made significant changes to the AFDC program, including the creation of TANF and the elimination of the federal funding for AFDC. The law also established a five-year block grant for TANF, which provided funding for states to implement work requirements and other reforms. Since then, most legislative activity has focused on extending TANF funding and making minor policy changes.\n\nTANF has undergone several extensions, with funding lapsing at various times due to budget constraints. The program has also undergone several policy changes, including the elimination of TANF bonus funds and the requirement that states implement work requirements for recipients. The program has also been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that it has not been effective in reducing poverty and promoting work among low-income families.\n\nOverall, the TANF program has undergone significant changes since its establishment in 1996, with a focus on promoting work and self-sufficiency among low-income families. While the program has faced challenges and controversy, it remains a critical source of funding for states to support low-income families and promote economic mobility.",
    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin, spanning over 246,000 square miles, is a vital water source for seven U.S. states and Mexico, supporting agriculture, municipalities, industry, and recreation. The Bureau of Reclamation, a part of the Department of the Interior, plays a crucial role in managing the basin's waters. The river's flow and stored water are essential for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation.\n\nA majority of the basin's water supplies, 70%, are used for irrigation, with nearly 40 million people relying on the river for municipal and industrial purposes. The river's flow and stored water also support power generation, habitat for endangered species, and recreational activities.\n\nPrecipitation and runoff in the basin are highly variable, with snowmelt in the northern areas driving the river's flow. Natural flows in the Colorado River Basin averaged 14.8 million acre-feet per year from 1906 to 2018, but have decreased to 12.4 million acre-feet per year from 2000 to 2018, with the 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 being the driest in over 100 years.\n\nThe federal government plays a significant role in managing the Colorado River, with Congress funding and overseeing facility operations, construction, and programs to protect and restore endangered species. The Law of the River, a set of compacts, laws, court decisions, and regulatory guidelines, governs Colorado River operations.\n\nThe 2012 Reclamation Study projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand in the basin, with decreasing flows and increasing demand. To address this, the 2019 Drought Contingency Plans were finalized, requiring states to curtail use and store water in Lake Mead to maintain higher levels. The plans aim to reduce the risk of further cutbacks and ensure the basin's water supplies can stretch.\n\nCongress may be interested in implementing the DCPs, monitoring their success, and planning for increased demand in the basin. The report highlights the importance of managing the Colorado River's waters sustainably to ensure the long-term health of the basin and its stakeholders.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees or officers. The law was enacted in 1946 to address the principle of sovereign immunity, which previously prohibited private citizens from suing the federal government without its consent. The FTCA provides a waiver of sovereign immunity, allowing plaintiffs to file tort lawsuits against the United States and potentially recover damages.\n\nThe FTCA serves two main functions: to deter people from committing torts and to compensate those who are injured. However, waiving the government's immunity from tort litigation comes with significant costs, including the annual expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars to pay tort claims. The law also imposes various limitations on the types and amount of damages that can be recovered, as well as procedural requirements for filing a lawsuit.\n\nThe FTCA has several exceptions to its waiver of sovereign immunity, including claims arising in a foreign country, combatant activities during wartime, and certain types of medical malpractice. The Feres doctrine, established by the Supreme Court, shields the federal government from liability for injuries to servicemen arising out of or incident to military service.\n\nThe FTCA also has limitations on damages, including a prohibition on punitive damages and prejudgment interest, and a cap on the amount of damages that can be recovered. The law requires plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit, and the government has six months to respond to a claim after receiving notice of a denied claim.\n\nThere have been proposals to amend the FTCA, including abrogating or narrowing the Feres doctrine, which shields the federal government from liability for certain types of medical malpractice claims. Some have also suggested passing private bills to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.\n\nOverall, the FTCA provides a framework for individuals to seek compensation for injuries caused by federal employees or officers, while also imposing limitations to ensure that the government is not unduly exposed to liability.",

These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers.\n\nFederal crop insurance is a permanent program that protects crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, plant diseases, and insect infestations, as well as declines in commodity prices. The program is available for most major crops and specialty crops, and eligible producers can receive catastrophic (CAT) coverage without paying a premium. CAT coverage provides a payment equal to 55% of the estimated market price of the commodity on crop losses in excess of 50% of normal yield.\n\nThe Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) provides financial assistance to farmers who grow crops that are not eligible for federal crop insurance. The program is available for crops such as alfalfa, barley, and oats, and provides payments to eligible producers based on the loss of their crop.\n\nLivestock and fruit tree disaster programs provide financial assistance to farmers who have suffered losses due to natural disasters. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pastureland or rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire. The program provides payments to eligible producers based on the number of months the county has been designated as a drought-affected area.\n\nEmergency disaster loans are available to farmers and ranchers who have suffered significant losses due to natural disasters. The loans are available for both crop and livestock producers and can be used to help recover from production losses or physical losses. The loans have a maximum loan amount of $500,000 and can be repaid within seven years for non-real estate losses and up to 20 years for real estate losses.\n\nIn addition to these programs, the USDA also has several other programs that provide financial and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers to repair damaged land following natural disasters. These programs include the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP), which provide financial assistance to farmers to restore their land to a productive state.\n\nThe 2018 farm bill made several changes to these programs, including expanding coverage under federal crop insurance, increasing the payment limits for NAP, and expanding the definition of eligible producers to include Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

The cleanup efforts have been ongoing since 1989 and have cost over $170 billion. The process of cleanup is complicated by multiple laws, agencies, and administrative steps, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Atomic Energy Act, and state hazardous waste laws.\n\nThe DOE has entered into federal facility agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and affected states to define the scope of cleanup work and establish deadlines for completion. These agreements can be renegotiated to incorporate new information, adjust schedules, and address changing conditions. The DOE also issues administrative compliance orders, court-ordered agreements, and settlement agreements to ensure compliance with environmental laws.\n\nThe cleanup program is managed by the DOE's Office of Environmental Management, which uses a cleanup policy and standard operating procedures to guide its activities. The policy states that the DOE will apply project management principles to its operations and that milestones are essential to the cleanup effort. The policy also emphasizes the importance of stakeholder involvement, including county and local governmental agencies, citizen groups, and other organizations.\n\nThe report highlights the challenges of the cleanup effort, including the complexity of the cleanup process, the need for additional funding, and the importance of stakeholder involvement.

States administer their own programs according to federal requirements and under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Unemployment Insurance. States have flexibility to set benefit amounts and duration, as well as establish eligibility requirements.\n\n**Work Search Requirements**\n\nFederal law requires UI claimants to actively search for work, but states have discretion to establish a reasonable definition of actively seeking work. States may require claimants to register with their state's Employment Service, which provides job search assistance, job placement assistance, and referrals to employers. Some states also require claimants to participate in reemployment services at an American Job Center.\n\n**Process for Identifying Work Search Overpayments**\n\nThe Department of Labor's Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system determines the accuracy of UI benefit payments and estimates the amount and rate of improper payments. States review randomly selected cases on a weekly basis and reconstruct the UI claims process to assess the accuracy of payments. States report the results of their BAM case reviews to DOL, which estimates improper payment rates and calculates a nationwide rate.\n\n**State Variability in Work Search Requirements**\n\nThe report highlights the variability in work search requirements across states, with some states requiring a minimum number of work search activities per week and others having broader definitions of what constitutes a work search activity. The report also notes that some states require claimants to report their work search activities to continue receiving benefits, which may prevent overpayments.\n\n**Overpayments**\n\nThe report estimates that about 37% of work search overpayments are uncovered during the claimant interview, and about 45% are uncovered by investigating claimant-provided job contacts. The report also notes that states with more cases with claimants who were required to search for work have lower work search overpayment rates.\n\n**Econometric Analysis**\n\nThe report uses econometric analysis to examine the relationship between work search overpayment rates and various factors, including the fraction of cases with claimants required to search for work, the fraction of cases with claimants who responded to the BAM audit in person, by telephone, or by mail, email, fax, or other method, and the fraction of",

However, a review of 78 federal buildings constructed under the program found that GSA does not systematically consider operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and functionality in the planning and design process.\n\nThe review found that GSA's one-size-fits-all approach to design does not consider whether non-public buildings need the same costly architectural elements as public landmarks. Additionally, GSA does not estimate or gather all perspectives from building and regional managers on the full O&M costs of design choices. This lack of consideration can lead to increased O&M costs and maintenance issues.\n\nThe review also found that GSA's process for collecting and sharing information on O&M costs in existing buildings is not systematic. The agency relies on Post Occupancy Evaluations (POEs) to assess building performance, but these evaluations do not provide a comprehensive picture of O&M costs.\n\nTo address these issues, the report recommends that the Administrator of the General Services Administration update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and consider and document how design choices may affect building functionality. The report also recommends that GSA systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.\n\nThe review found that GSA has made design choices that decrease and increase O&M costs. For example, the use of natural light in Design Excellence buildings has reduced energy costs, while the location of mechanical systems has increased repair costs. The review also found that GSA's efforts to consider O&M costs and functionality in the planning and design process are not consistent with pertinent standards for internal control in the federal government.\n\nOverall, the review highlights the need for GSA to improve its approach to designing and managing federal buildings, including the consideration of O&M costs and functionality, to ensure that these buildings are efficient, effective, and sustainable.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense's (DOD) Excess Controlled Property (LESO) program allows federal law enforcement agencies to acquire excess property from the DOD at no cost. The program has been used for various law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security efforts. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the program has several weaknesses in its processes for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk.\n\nThe GAO report found that DOD's internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency applications were inadequate, as DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and did not conduct site visits to verify the legitimacy of applications. The report also found that DLA's internal controls for transferring property were weak, as personnel did not verify the quantity of approved items before transfer, and did not maintain accurate accountability records.\n\nThe GAO report also found that DLA lacked a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures, and had not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program. The report made four recommendations to DOD to address these weaknesses, including revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with transfer procedures, issuing guidance on verifying the type and quantity of approved items, and conducting a fraud risk assessment.\n\nThe DOD concurred with the GAO's recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. The LESO program has been used by various law enforcement agencies to acquire property, including vehicles, equipment, and other items, which have been used for various law enforcement activities. The program has also been used to support disaster response efforts, such as the rescue of stranded individuals in floodwaters.\n\nOverall, the GAO report highlights the need for DOD to strengthen its internal controls and processes for the LESO program to prevent fraud and ensure the secure transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a government agency responsible for reviewing foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies to determine if they pose a threat to national security. The agency was established in 1975 and is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. CFIUS reviews a wide range of transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, and joint ventures, to ensure that they do not compromise national security.\n\nIn recent years, CFIUS has reviewed over 1,000 transactions, with the majority coming from the manufacturing sector. The largest number of transactions reviewed by CFIUS come from China, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The agency has also reviewed transactions involving companies in the technology sector, including semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nCFIUS uses a variety of factors to determine if a transaction poses a national security risk, including the potential impact on U.S. critical technologies, the potential for foreign control of U.S. businesses, and the potential for the transaction to affect U.S. international technological leadership.\n\nThe agency's workload has increased significantly in recent years, with the number of transactions reviewed by CFIUS growing from 10 in 2011 to 67 in 2016. This has put a strain on the agency's staff, with some officials expressing concerns about the ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, has taken steps to address the agency's workload, including working with other agencies to assess staffing levels. However, the agency's ability to effectively review transactions and address national security concerns remains a concern.\n\nOverall, CFIUS plays a critical role in protecting national security by reviewing foreign acquisitions and ensuring that they do not compromise U.S. interests. However, the agency's workload and staffing levels require careful management to ensure that it can effectively perform its duties.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* The Secretary of the Treasury should coordinate with other agencies to better understand the current and projected staffing levels needed to address the CFIUS workload.\n* The agency should continue to review and assess the effectiveness of its current staffing levels and make adjustments as needed.\n* The agency should also consider implementing measures to improve its ability to review non-notified transactions and monitor mitigation measures.\n\nBy taking these steps, CFIUS can ensure that it can effectively review foreign acquisitions and protect national security interests.",
