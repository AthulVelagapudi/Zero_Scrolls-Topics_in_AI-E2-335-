It is to be a central part of the U.S. response to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which launched in 2013. The act states that it is U.S. policy to \"facilitate market-based private sector development and inclusive economic growth in less developed countries\" through financing, including to provide countries a robust alternative to state-directed investments by authoritarian governments and strategic competitors using best practices with respect to transparency and environmental and social safeguards, and which take into account the debt sustainability of partner countries (\u00a71411).",
    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the 1935 Social Security Act. It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its programs. The enactment of the 1939 Social Security Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379) added \"survivor\" benefits to the program of old age benefits, renaming it Old Age and Survivors Insurance. Survivor benefits, like old age benefits, were social insurance benefits earned through work in a covered job and paid to spouses and children upon the death of a worker or retiree. This provided an alternative, and more universal, means of aiding widows and their children. The Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-881) added Disability Insurance to Old Age and Survivor Insurance, with the combined program now commonly referred to as Social Security. The 1956 amendments also expanded the types of jobs covered by Social Security. These changes, too, provided more universal means of aiding the types of families that were originally assisted by ADC.",
