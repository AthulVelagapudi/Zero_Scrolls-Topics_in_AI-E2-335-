    "va-sq-11": "The Industrial Designer disagreed with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control because the User Interface suggested a rounded, pod-like shape, while the Industrial Designer was open to a more traditional, non-remote-like design.",
    "va-sq-50": "The discussion about industrial components in the meeting transcript revolves around the design of a new remote control. The team is considering two main industrial components: titanium and spongy materials. They are deciding whether to use a titanium material that can be shaped like a fruit, such as a banana, or a spongy material. The team is also discussing the importance of having a user-friendly design with a limited number of buttons and a simple output system. They are considering keeping the traditional battery-powered design and avoiding reinventing the wheel. The trend of using fruit and vegetable-inspired designs is also mentioned, with the team deciding to explore this idea further.",
    "va-sq-57": "The marketing learned that trends are quite the same in many areas, and that the current trend is for remote controls to have a fancy look and feel, with a focus on being innovative and novel. They also learned that people are more interested in having a remote control that is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface, rather than one that is technologically advanced. Additionally, they learned that people tend to change their remote controls more often than their batteries, and that the trend is moving faster than the life of the remote control itself.",
    "va-sq-58": "The discussion about appearance design focused on the trend of making remote controls more visually appealing and user-friendly. The team considered two main options: making the remote control look like a fruit, specifically a banana, or using a spongy material. They also discussed the importance of having a simple and intuitive design, with a limited number of buttons and a clear output that indicates the actions of each button. The team decided to stick with a classical design, using two batteries and avoiding reinventing the wheel. They also considered the trend of people changing their remote controls more often than batteries, and therefore, prioritizing a design that can be easily updated.",
    "va-gq-66": "The meeting was a final design meeting for a remote control product. The team discussed the design, including a prototype presentation, evaluation criteria, and financial constraints. They decided to simplify the design by removing a scroll wheel and replacing it with two buttons, which was within the budget. The team evaluated the project and found it to be productive, with some minor issues with time pressure. The meeting concluded with the team discussing the final questionnaire and meeting summary, and the project manager suggesting that they stay in the room to complete the necessary tasks.",
    "va-gq-93": "The meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer, which provides 30 hours of free childcare for 3-4 year olds from low-income families. The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, reported that the early implementer local authority areas have had a mixed experience with the rollout, with some areas finding it challenging due to bureaucracy and administrative burdens. The Minister acknowledged that the offer has been well-received by parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are seeing benefits such as increased disposable income and more flexibility to balance work and childcare.\n\nThe committee raised several concerns, including the potential to exacerbate disadvantage for summer-born children who only receive 3 terms of the offer, and the lack of awareness among parents about the UK tax-free childcare offer. The Minister and officials acknowledged these concerns and committed to improving communication and integration with the UK Government's offer.\n\nThe committee also discussed the quality of childcare, with a focus on ensuring that providers are meeting the required standards. The Minister mentioned that the Welsh Government is working to increase the qualifications of childcare staff and improve the quality of childcare.\n\nThe meeting concluded with the committee resolving to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that the trend of filling only 65% of the target places for teacher training in Welsh teacher training centres is a problem that needs to be addressed.

    "va-sq-117": "Eluned Morgan, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that the Welsh Government is keeping a close eye on the pay dispute situation in the Further Education (FE) sector, but she did not take a proactive role in resolving the issue. She acknowledged that the dispute is related to the pay settlement for schoolteachers, and the FE sector needs additional funding to meet the pay award. She emphasized that the Welsh Government does not have the funds to support the sector, and it is up to ColegauCymru to negotiate with the trade unions. She also mentioned that the UK Government's decision not to provide additional funding for the sector is a major obstacle to resolving the dispute.",

Additionally, they want to make sure that the remote control is made of high-quality materials and has a long battery life.",
    "va-gq-166": "The meeting discussed the progress on the TORRENT chip project. Professor B mentioned that they were two months away from being done, but it took two years to complete. The team went through old emails and found that the project was delayed due to unrealistic schedules. The team decided to wait for Sunil to arrive before proceeding with his part of the project. They also discussed the VTS (Voice Transformation System) method, which was tested on the SpeechDat-Car Italian dataset. The team considered applying VTS in the cepstral domain and normalizing the speech signal before applying VTS. They also discussed the pros and cons of different methods and the potential combination of a few of them. The meeting concluded with a review of the transcript and a decision to read some digits.",

He also mentioned that the design should be adaptable to the user's needs, and that the buttons should be easy to use. He also suggested that the remote control should have a \"previous\" button to allow users to undo their previous actions, and that it should be able to record sequences of actions.",
