The Bureau of Reclamation plays a significant role in managing the basin's waters, serving as water master for the Lower Basin states. The river's primary uses are agricultural irrigation, municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes, power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation.\n\nA majority of the basin's water supplies (70%) are used for irrigation, with nearly 40 million people relying on M&I water supplies. The river's flow and stored water also support power production, habitat for endangered species, and recreation. However, the basin's water management is threatened by drought, climate change, and population growth, which may lead to water shortages and increased competition for this limited resource.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Colorado River Basin states have developed various agreements and plans to conserve water and manage the river's resources sustainably. The 2007 Interim Guidelines and Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead aim to reduce the risk of Lake Powell's elevation falling below 3,490 ft, while the 2019 Drought Contingency Plans require Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail use and contribute to Lake Mead storage at predetermined trigger elevations.\n\nCongress plays a crucial role in funding and overseeing Colorado River projects and programs, including the development of new tribal water supplies and infrastructure.

    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows individuals to sue the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees and officers. The FTCA serves two main purposes: to deter people from committing torts and to compensate those who are injured. However, until the mid-20th century, the principle of sovereign immunity prohibited individuals from suing the federal government for torts committed by its agents. The FTCA was enacted in 1946 to address this issue.\n\nThe FTCA allows plaintiffs to sue the United States for certain types of torts, including those committed by federal employees and officers. Some examples of FTCA cases include minor accidents on federal property and allegations of government misfeasance, such as the 1991 Tailhook Convention and the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco.\n\nThe FTCA has several limitations on damages, including a statute of limitations and exhaustion provisions. A plaintiff must present their claim to the relevant federal agency and have it denied before filing a lawsuit in federal court. The agency has six months to make a final decision, and if it fails to do so, the claimant can file a lawsuit within six months of the agency's failure to act.\n\nThe FTCA also has several exceptions to the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity, including the foreign country exception, the combatant activities exception, and the Feres doctrine. The Feres doctrine shields the federal government from liability for injuries to servicemen that arise out of or are incident to military service.\n\nThere have been proposals to modify the FTCA, including abrogating or narrowing the Feres doctrine. Some have argued that the doctrine is unjust and should be modified to allow servicemembers to pursue tort claims against the United States. Others have argued that the doctrine is necessary to maintain military discipline and effectiveness.\n\nIn addition to modifying the FTCA, Congress has the authority to enact private legislation to compensate individual tort victims who would otherwise be barred from obtaining recourse from the United States under the FTCA.",

These programs include federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers.\n\nThe federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized and administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA). It protects crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, plant diseases, and declines in commodity prices. Crop insurance is available for most major crops.\n\nThe NAP provides financial assistance to farmers who suffer crop losses due to natural disasters. The program is also permanently authorized and has been expanded by the 2018 farm bill to include more crops and to increase the payment limits.\n\nLivestock and fruit tree disaster programs provide assistance to farmers who suffer losses due to natural disasters. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pastureland or on rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire.\n\nEmergency disaster loans are available to farmers and ranchers who suffer significant losses due to natural disasters. These loans can be used to help recover from production losses or physical losses, such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment.\n\nIn addition to these programs, USDA also has several permanent disaster assistance programs that help producers repair damaged land following natural disasters. These programs include the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP).\n\nThe 2018 farm bill made several amendments to these programs, including expanding crop eligibility, increasing payment limits, and creating separate payment limits for catastrophic and buy-up coverage. The bill also authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance.\n\nUSDA also has discretionary authority to distribute emergency payments to farmers with \"Section 32\" and CCC funds. These funds can be used to support U.S. agriculture and provide disaster assistance to farmers.\n\nOverall, the USDA's disaster assistance programs provide critical support to farmers and ranchers who suffer losses due to natural disasters.

The DOD-treated water is treated by the Department of Defense, while non-DOD-treated water is treated by private companies or local utilities.\n\n**Regulatory Framework**\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act, which sets national primary drinking water regulations. The EPA has issued regulations for approximately 90 drinking water contaminants, and states may have additional regulations that are at least as stringent. The DOD is responsible for ensuring that its drinking water systems comply with these regulations.\n\n**Compliance and Reporting**\n\nOur review found that DOD's drinking water systems complied with EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations at a level comparable to other systems in the United States. However, we identified that the military departments did not report all violations of these regulations to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD(EI&E). This lack of reporting may be due to unclear or inadequate reporting requirements.\n\n**Emerging Contaminants**\n\nThe DOD has identified 21 emerging contaminants in its drinking water, including 10 that have been regulated by the EPA and 11 that are currently unregulated but have an EPA-issued drinking water health advisory. The DOD has taken steps to address some of these contaminants, but more work is needed to ensure that all emerging contaminants are properly regulated and addressed.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nWe recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, identify and implement any necessary changes to DOD's environmental compliance policy to clarify reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations. We also recommend that the Secretaries of the military departments identify and implement actions to increase understanding among their personnel about DOD's reporting requirements for drinking water violations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, while DOD's drinking water systems generally comply with EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations, there are areas for improvement, particularly in reporting requirements and addressing emerging contaminants. By addressing these issues, the DOD can ensure that its drinking water systems meet the highest standards of quality and safety for military personnel and their families.",

Additionally, GSA does not estimate or gather all perspectives from building and regional managers on the full O&M costs of design choices, nor does it share information on the O&M costs of design choices in existing buildings.\n\nThe review also found that design choices in GSA's Design Excellence buildings have increased O&M costs, including inefficiently located mechanical systems, difficult-to-access lights, and difficult-to-maintain materials and finishes. Building managers reported that these design choices have led to increased costs, including repair and maintenance expenses.\n\nTo address these issues, the report recommends that the Administrator of the General Services Administration update existing procedures to require GSA officials to estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process, obtain information from personnel responsible for addressing O&M consequences, and consider and document how design choices may affect building functionality. Additionally, the report recommends that GSA systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings.\n\nThe review was conducted from May 2017 to May 2018 and was based on a review of federal regulations, GSA procedures and policies, prior GAO work, and reports from other federal agencies and professional organizations. The review found that GSA's efforts to consider O&M costs in the planning and design of Design Excellence buildings were not consistent with pertinent standards for internal control in the federal government.",
    "gao_GAO-17-781T": "The Department of Defense's (DOD) Excess Controlled Property (LESO) program allows federal law enforcement agencies to acquire excess property from the DOD at no cost. The program has been used for various law enforcement activities, including counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security efforts. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the program has several weaknesses in its processes for verifying and approving applications, transferring property, and assessing risk.\n\nThe GAO report found that DOD's internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency applications were inadequate, as DLA personnel did not routinely request and verify identification of individuals picking up controlled property, and did not conduct site visits to verify the legitimacy of applications. The report also found that DLA's internal controls for transferring property were weak, as personnel did not verify the quantity of approved items before transfer, and did not maintain accurate accountability records.\n\nThe GAO report also found that DLA lacked a comprehensive framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures, and had not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program. The report made four recommendations to DOD to address these weaknesses, including revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, ensuring compliance with transfer procedures, issuing guidance on verifying the type and quantity of approved items, and conducting a fraud risk assessment.\n\nThe DOD concurred with the GAO's recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one. The LESO program has been used by various law enforcement agencies to acquire property, including vehicles, equipment, and other items, which have been used for various law enforcement activities. The program has also been used to support disaster response efforts, such as the rescue of stranded individuals in floodwaters.\n\nOverall, the GAO report highlights the need for DOD to strengthen its internal controls and processes for the LESO program to prevent fraud and ensure the secure transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies.",
