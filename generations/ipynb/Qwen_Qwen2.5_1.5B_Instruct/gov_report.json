    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193). It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children\u2014specifically, those headed by single mothers\u2014that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s. The 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. Most of the legislative activity on TANF since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for TANF. Most of these extensions did not change TANF policy, though policy changes were included in extensions enacted in 2006, 2010, and 2012. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.

    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin spans seven U.S. states and Mexico, covering more than 246,000 square miles. The river is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates water storage and conveyance facilities. The federal government plays a prominent role in managing the basin's waters, especially in the Lower Basin. The Colorado River is used primarily for irrigation and M&I purposes, with much of the area relying on the river for water supplies outside of the basin's drainage area. The river's flow and stored water are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The basin experiences highly variable precipitation and runoff, with drought periods lasting for decades. The federal government has played a central role in managing the Colorado River since the early 20th century, including approving the Colorado River Compact and various agreements and decrees. The 2007 Interim Guidelines established criteria for releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead during drought or shortages, and the pilot system conservation program allows for voluntary conservation projects to be applied toward storage in Lake Mead. Despite the federal government's involvement, competition for water resources persists, particularly in the Lower Basin, where consumptive use has consistently exceeded natural flows since 2000. The current drought has exacerbated the situation, and efforts to manage the basin's water resources continue.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows citizens to sue the United States government for tortious acts committed by federal employees. The FTCA waives the government's sovereign immunity from certain types of tort claims, but it also imposes significant limitations on the types of claims that a plaintiff may pursue against the United States. One of the most frequently litigated exceptions to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity is the discretionary function exception, which protects the government from liability for discretionary acts performed by its employees. Another important exception is the intentional tort exception, which shields the government from liability for intentional torts committed by its employees. The law enforcement proviso, added in 1974, exempts certain intentional torts committed by investigative or law enforcement officers from the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. Overall, the FTCA strikes a delicate balance between protecting the government from excessive liability and ensuring that citizens can obtain compensation for tortious acts committed by federal employees.",

    "gao_GAO-18-486": "This report discusses the federal-state UI program, which provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. It highlights key aspects of the program, including:\n\n1. Background: The federal-state UI program administers its own programs based on certain federal requirements and under the oversight of DOL's Office of Unemployment Insurance. States have considerable flexibility to set benefit amounts and durations, as well as eligibility requirements.\n\n2. Work Search Requirements: Federal law establishes a work search requirement for UI eligibility, but the specifics vary by state. States must have laws specifying that UI claimants must be \"actively seeking work\" as a condition of eligibility for unemployment compensation. \n\n3. Process for Identifying Work Search Overpayments: DOL uses its Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) system to determine the accuracy of UI benefit payments and estimate the amount and rate of improper payments. BAM audits involve reviewing existing records and original fact-finding by state BAM investigators. Claims are classified as acceptable, unverifiable, or unacceptable based on documentation and claimant reports.\n\n4. Reported Causes of UI Improper Payments: Since 2002, federal agencies have been required to identify and report improper payments. The leading cause of UI improper payments in fiscal year 2017 was overpayments to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. Other major causes included payments made to individuals who continued to claim even after returning to work and payments made to claimants who were determined ineligible due to disqualifying job separations.\n\n5. Trend in Work Search Overpayments: Work search overpayment rates have risen in recent years, with an estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments in fiscal year 2017. The national work search overpayment rate increased from 4.5% in fiscal year 2016 to 6% in fiscal year 2017.\n\n6. Selected States' Approaches to Addressing Work Search Overpayments: Six states used different approaches to address work search overpayments, including online systems, work search audits, and messaging to inform claimants of their responsibilities. Despite these efforts, some states faced challenges with verifying work search activities.\n\n7. Recommendations for Executive Action: The report recommends that the Assistant Secretary of DOL's Employment and Training Administration provide states with information about its determination that the use of state formal warning policies is no longer permissible under federal law, monitor states' efforts to discontinue the use of formal warning policies, clarify information on work search verification requirements in revised Benefit Accuracy Measurement procedures, and monitor states' compliance with the clarified work search verification requirements.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes the importance of accurately determining individuals' eligibility for UI benefits and the need for states to implement effective work search requirements and verification mechanisms to prevent improper payments. It also highlights the ongoing challenges states face in verifying work search activities and the need for clearer guidance and monitoring to ensure compliance with federal requirements.",
