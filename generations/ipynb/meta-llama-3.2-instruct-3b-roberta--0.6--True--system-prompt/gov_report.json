    "crs_R44668": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, formerly known as the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, is a federal block grant program established in 1996 as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. The program replaced the AFDC program and provided funding to states to support low-income families with children. The law aimed to promote work and self-sufficiency among recipients by providing cash assistance and other services.\n\nPrior to the 1996 law, the AFDC program was a federal entitlement program that provided cash assistance to needy families, including single mothers. However, the program faced criticism for its limited effectiveness in promoting work and self-sufficiency among recipients. The 1996 law aimed to address these concerns by introducing a block grant program that gave states more flexibility in designing their programs and services.\n\nThe TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act raised the work requirement for TANF recipients and introduced a block grant structure. The law also provided funding for vocational education and job training programs. In 2002, the TANF block grant was reauthorized, and the law required states to implement work requirements and increase the number of recipients working or participating in work activities.\n\nIn 2005, the Deficit Reduction Act eliminated the TANF bonus fund, which provided additional funding for states to implement innovative programs. The law also required states to report on their TANF expenditures and outcomes. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided additional funding for TANF and allowed states to use TANF funds for child care and other services.\n\nIn 2011, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act extended TANF funding for two years. The law also prohibited the use of TANF funds for certain activities, such as strip clubs and liquor stores. In 2012, the Consolidated Appropriations Act extended TANF funding for another two years and required states to report on their TANF expenditures and outcomes.\n\nIn 2013, the Consolidated Appropriations Act extended TANF funding for another two years. The law also required states to implement a \"work first\" approach, which prioritizes work and self-sufficiency among TANF recipients. In 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act extended TANF funding for another two years and required states to implement a new evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of TANF programs.\n\nToday",
    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin is a vital water source for seven states, including Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California. The basin spans 246,000 square miles and provides water for agricultural irrigation, municipal, industrial, and power production, as well as recreation and wildlife habitats. The river's water flow is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact, signed in 1922, established a framework for apportioning water among the seven states, with the Upper and Lower Basins having different allocations. The compact has undergone several revisions, including the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, which increased water allocations to Mexico and established a governance framework for the river.\n\nThe compact has been subject to drought and water shortages, leading to concerns about the long-term sustainability of the basin's water supply. In response, Congress has passed several laws and authorizations to address these issues, including the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 and the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum.\n\nThe compact has also been the subject of controversy, particularly with regards to water rights and allocations. The 1963 Arizona v. California Supreme Court case ruled in favor of Arizona, establishing the principle that the compact's apportionment of water was controlled by state law.\n\nIn recent years, the compact has been the focus of negotiations to address drought and water shortages. The 2007 Interim Guidelines for the Lower Basin Shortages Operations, for example, established a framework for reducing water use in the Lower Basin during times of drought. The 2019 Drought Contingency Plan, authorized by Congress, aims to conserve water in the basin and reduce the risk of shortages.\n\nThe compact has also been the subject of several water rights settlements, including the 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act, which resolved water rights disputes between Arizona and other states. Additionally, Congress has authorized funding for projects such as the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, which aims to provide water for the Navajo Nation.\n\nOverall, the Colorado River Compact remains a critical framework for managing the Colorado River Basin's water resources, but its future is uncertain due to drought, climate change, and other factors.",
    "crs_R45732": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is a federal law that allows individuals to sue the United States government for damages resulting from tortious conduct, such as negligence, wrongful conduct, or intentional acts. The law was enacted in 1946 to provide a means for citizens to seek compensation for injuries caused by the government's employees or actions.\n\nThe FTCA serves two main functions: to deter tortious behavior and to compensate victims of government wrongdoing. The law waives the government's sovereign immunity from liability, allowing plaintiffs to sue the government for damages. However, the law also has limitations and exceptions, such as the discretionary function exception, which shields government officials from liability for actions taken within the scope of their employment.\n\nThe FTCA applies to a wide range of cases, including those involving government employees, military personnel, and contractors. However, the law excludes claims against the government for intentional torts, such as assault and battery, and claims arising from the government's exercise of discretion or judgment.\n\nThe law also has procedural requirements, such as the requirement to file a claim with the relevant federal agency within two years of the incident. If the agency denies the claim, the plaintiff can then file a lawsuit in federal court. The law also limits the amount of damages that can be awarded, and it bars the awarding of attorney's fees to the plaintiff.\n\nThere have been proposals to amend the FTCA, including abrogating the Feres doctrine, which shields the government from liability for injuries to military personnel. Some lawmakers have argued that the doctrine bars servicemembers from seeking recourse for injuries in military hospitals, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the military's ability to discipline its personnel.\n\nIn summary, the FTCA provides a means for citizens to seek compensation for injuries caused by the government's wrongdoing, but it also has limitations and exceptions that must be navigated by plaintiffs. The law's provisions and exceptions are subject to ongoing debate and proposal for amendment.",
