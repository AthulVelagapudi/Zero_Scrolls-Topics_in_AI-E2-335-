    "va-gq-93": "The meeting discussed the Welsh Government's childcare offer, which includes a 30-hour childcare offer for working parents. The Minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, reported that the early piloting of the scheme has learned lessons and will be expanded to more areas. The Minister mentioned that the scheme is not just about childcare but also about supporting parents' work-life balance and enabling them to work more hours. The Minister acknowledged that the scheme may not be suitable for all families, particularly those with complex needs or those who cannot afford the additional costs. The Minister also mentioned that the scheme will be phased in, with a focus on areas with high demand and limited supply.\n\nThe Minister addressed concerns about the administrative burden on local authorities and the potential for unequal access to the scheme. The Minister assured that the Welsh Government is committed to making the scheme more accessible and affordable for all families, including those in rural areas.\n\nThe meeting also discussed the issue of grandparents providing childcare, with some grandparents expressing concerns about being registered and receiving support. The Minister clarified that grandparents are not eligible for the scheme, but the Welsh Government is considering a separate scheme for grandparents.\n\nThe meeting touched on the topic of childcare provision for children with complex needs, with the Minister acknowledging that the current provision is not sufficient. The Minister mentioned that the Welsh Government is working with the third sector and local authorities to improve the quality and availability of childcare for children with complex needs.\n\nThe meeting also discussed the issue of the \u00a34.50 per hour rate for childcare, with some concerns about its affordability for working families. The Minister assured that the rate is a good starting point, but acknowledged that it may not be sufficient for all families. The Minister mentioned that the Welsh Government is open to adjusting the rate if necessary.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a discussion about the need for a more nuanced approach to childcare provision, one that takes into account the diverse needs of families and communities across Wales. The Minister emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Welsh Government, local authorities, and the third sector to ensure that the childcare offer is effective and accessible to all families.",
    "va-sq-108": "Kirsty Williams stated that this year's intake of teachers for secondary school training at Welsh teacher training centers had recruited to 65% of targets. She attributed the low recruitment rate to a combination of factors, including the fact that the process for ITE provision is not perfect, and there is a lack of understanding of the needs of the profession. She mentioned that the Welsh Government has taken steps to address the issue, including offering financial incentives of up to \u00a320,000 per year for graduates who pursue a teaching qualification, and a new ITE recruitment marketing exercise targeting Welsh students studying priority subjects. She also mentioned that a new advisory board has been set up to support teacher retention and that the Government is working to improve the quality of ITE provision.",
