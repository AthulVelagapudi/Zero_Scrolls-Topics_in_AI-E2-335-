Story:
SLINGSHOTBYIRVING W.  LANDEIllustrated by EmshThe slingshot    was, I believe, one of the few  weapons of history that wasn't used in the last war.That doesn't mean it won't be used in the next!"Got a bogey at three o'clock high.Range about six hundred miles."   Johnson spoke casually, but his voice  in the intercom was thin with tension.Captain Paul Coulter, commanding  Space Fighter 308, 58th Squadron,  33rd Fighter Wing, glanced up outof his canopy in the direction indicated,  and smiled to himself at the  instinctive reaction.  Nothing therebut the familiar starry backdrop, the  moon far down to the left.  If the  light wasn't right, a ship might beinvisible at half a mile.  He squeezed  the throttle mike button.  "Any IFF?""No IFF.""O.K., let me know as soon as youhave his course."  Coulter squashed  out his cigar and began his cockpit  check, grinning without humor as henoticed that his breathing had deepened  and his palms were moist on  the controls.  He looked down tomake sure his radio was snug in its  pocket on his leg; checked the thigh  harness of his emergency rocket,  wrapped in its thick belly pad; checkedthe paired tanks of oxygen behind  him, hanging level from his shoulders  into their niche in the "cradle."He flipped his helmet closed, locked  it, and opened it again.  He tossed  a sardonic salute at the photographof a young lady who graced the side  of the cockpit.  "Wish us luck, sugar."He pressed the mike button again."You got anything yet, Johnny?""He's going our way, Paul. Have  it exact in a minute."Coulter scanned the full arch ofsky visible through the curving panels  of the dome, thinking the turgid  thoughts that always came when action  was near.His chest was full of  the familiar weakness—not fear exactly,  but a tight, helpless feeling  that grew and grew with the waiting.His eyes and hands were busy in  the familiar procedure, readying the  ship for combat, checking and re-checkingthe details that could mean  life and death, but his mind watched  disembodied, yearning back to earth.Sylvia always came back first.  Inviting  smile and outstretched hands.Nyloned knees, pink sweater, and  that clinging, clinging white silk  skirt.  A whirling montage of laughing,challenging eyes and tossing sky-black  hair and soft arms tightening  around his neck.Then Jean, cool and self-possessed  and slightly disapproving,  with warmth and humor peeping  through from underneath when shesmiled.  A lazy, crinkly kind of smile,  like Christmas lights going on one  by one.He wished he'd acted more  grown up that night they watched  the rain dance at the pueblo.  For thehundredth time, he went over what  he remembered of their last date,  seeing the gleam of her shoulder, and  the angry disappointment in her eyes;hearing again his awkward apologies.   She was a nice kid.  Silently his mouthformed the words.  "You're a nice  kid."I think she loves me.  She was justmad because I got drunk.The tension of approaching combat  suddenly blended with the memory,  welling up into a rush of tenderness  and affection.He whispered her  name, and suddenly he knew that if  he got back he was going to ask her  to marry him.He thought of his father, rocking  on the porch of the Pennsylvania  farm, pipe in his mouth, the weatheredold face serene, as he puffed and  listened to the radio beside him.  He  wished he'd written him last night,instead of joining the usual beer and  bull session in the wardroom.  He  wished—.He wished."I've got him, Paul.  He's got twopoint seven miles of RV on us.  Take  thirty degrees high on two point one  o'clock for course to IP."Automatically he turned the controlwheel to the right and eased it  back.  The gyros recorded the turn to  course."Hold 4 G's for one six five seconds,  then coast two minutes for initial  point five hundred miles on histail.""Right, Johnny. One sixty-five,  then two minutes."He set the timer,  advanced the throttle to 4 G's, and  stepped back an inch as the acceleration  took him snugly into the cradle.The Return-To-Station-Fuel and Relative-Velocity-To-Station  gauges did  their usual double takes on a changeof course, as the ship computer recorded  the new information.  He  liked those two gauges—the two oldladies.Mrs. RSF kept track of how much  more fuel they had than they neededto get home.  When they were moving  away from station, she dropped  in alarmed little jumps, but whenthey were headed home, she inched  along in serene contentment, or if  they were coasting, sneaked triumphantly  back up the dial.Mrs. RVS started to get jittery at  about ten mps away from home, and  above fifteen, she was tremblingsteadily.  He didn't blame the old  ladies for worrying.  With one hourof fuel at 5 G's, you didn't fire a  single squirt unless there was a good  reason for it.  Most of their time ona mission was spent free wheeling,  in the anxiety-laden boredom that  fighting men have always known.Wish the Red was coming in across  our course.It would have taken lessfuel, and the chase wouldn't have  taken them so far out.  But then  they'd probably have been spotted,and lost the precious element of surprise.He blessed the advantage of better  radar.In this crazy "war," so like  the dogfights of the first world war,  the better than two hundred mile  edge of American radar was moreoften than not the margin of victory.   The American crews were a little  sharper, a little better trained, butwith their stripped down ships, and  midget crewmen, with no personal  safety equipment, the Reds could  accelerate longer and faster, and gofarther out.  You had to get the jump  on them, or it was just too bad.The second hand hit forty-five in  its third cycle, and he stood loose in  the cradle as the power died.Sixty-two combat missions but the  government says there's no war.Hismind wandered back over eight years  in the service.  Intelligence tests.  Physicaltests.  Psychological tests.  Six  months of emotional adjustment inthe screep.  Primary training.  Basic  and advanced training.The pride and  excitement of being chosen for space  fighters.  By the time he graduated,the United States and Russia each had  several satellite stations operating, but  in 1979, the United States had won  the race for a permanent station onthe Moon.  What a grind it had been,  bringing in the supplies.A year later the Moon station had  "blown up."  No warning.  No survivors.Just a brand-new medium-sized  crater.  And six months later,the new station, almost completed,  went up again.  The diplomats had  buzzed like hornets, with accusationsand threats, but nothing could be  proven—therewere      bombs stored atthe station.  The implication was clear  enough.  There wasn't going to beany Moon station until one government  ruled Earth.  Or until the United  States and Russia figured out a wayto get along with each other.  And so  far, getting along with Russia was  like trying to get along with anoctopus.Of course there were rumors that  the psych warfare boys had somegimmick cooked up, to turn the  U. S. S. R. upside down in a revolution,  the next time power changed  hands, but he'd been hearing that onefor years.  Still, with four new dictators  over there in the last eleven  years, there was always a chance.Anyway, he was just a space  jockey, doing his job in this screwball  fight out here in the empty reaches.Back on Earth, there was no war.  The  statesmen talked, held conferences,played international chess as ever.   Neither side bothered the other's  satellites, though naturally they wereon permanent alert.  There just wasn't  going to be any Moon station for a  while.Nobody knew what there  might be on the Moon, but if one  side couldn't have it, then the other  side wasn't going to have it either.And meanwhile, the struggle was  growing deadlier, month by month,  each side groping for the stranglehold,looking for the edge that would  give domination of space, or make  all-out war a good risk.  They hadn'tfound it yet, but it was getting bloodier  out here all the time.  For a while,  it had been a supreme achievementjust to get a ship out and back, but  gradually, as the ships improved,  there was a little margin left over for  weapons.Back a year ago, the average  patrol was nothing but a sightseeing  tour.  Not that there was much to see,when you'd been out a few times.   Now, there were Reds around practically  every mission.Thirteen missions to go, after today.He wondered if he'd quit atseventy-five.  Deep inside him, the old  pride and excitement were still  strong.He still got a kick out of the  way the girls looked at the silver  rocket on his chest.  But he didn'tfeel as lucky as he used to.  Twenty-nine  years old, and he was starting  to feel like an old man.He pictured  himself lecturing to a group of eager  kids.Had a couple of close calls, those  last two missions.That Red hadlooked easy, the way he was wandering  around.  He hadn't spotted them  until they were well into their run,but when he got started he'd made  them look like slow motion, just the  same.  If he hadn't tried that harebrainedsudden deceleration....   Coulter shook his head at the memory.And on the last mission they'd  been lucky to get a draw.  Those boys  were good shots."We're crossing his track, Paul.Turn to nine point five o'clock and  hold 4 G's for thirty-two seconds,  starting on the count... five—four—three—two—one—go!"He completed  the operation in silence, remarking  to himself how lucky he wasto have Johnson.  The boy loved a  chase.  He navigated like a hungryhawk, though you had to admit his  techniques were a bit irregular.Coulter chuckled at the ad lib waythey operated, remembering the  courses, the tests, the procedures practiced  until they could do them backwards  blindfolded.When they tangled  with a Red, the Solter co-ordinates  went out the hatch.  They navigatedby the enemy.  There were times  during a fight when he had no more  idea of his position than what theold ladies told him, and what he  could see of the Sun, the Earth, and  the Moon.And using "right side up" as a  basis for navigation.  He chuckled  again.Still, the service had had to  concede on "right side up," in designing  the ships, so there was something  to be said for it.They hadn't  been able to simulate gravity without  fouling up the ships so they had  to call the pilot's head "up."There  was something comforting about it.   He'd driven a couple of the experimentaljobs, one with the cockpit set  on gimbals, and one where the whole  ship rotated, and he hadn't cared for  them at all.Felt disoriented, with  something nagging at his mind all  the time, as though the ships had  been sabotaged.A couple of pilots  had gone nuts in the "spindizzy,"  and remembering his own feelings as  he watched the sky go by, it was easyto understand.Anyway, "right side up" tied in  perfectly with the old "clock" systemGarrity had dug out of those magazines  he was always reading.  Once  they got used to it, it had turned outreally handy.  Old Doc Hoffman, his  astrogation prof, would have turned  purple if he'd ever dreamed they'duse such a conglomeration.  But  it worked.  And when you werein a hurry, it worked in a hurry, and  that was good enough for Coulter.   He'd submitted a report on it toColonel Silton."You've got him, Paul.  We'redead on his tail, five hundred miles  back, and matching velocity.  Turn  forty-two degrees right, and you'relined up right on him."  Johnson was  pleased with the job he'd done.Coulter watched the pip move into  his sightscreen.  It settled less than a  degree off dead center.He made the  final corrections in course, set the air  pressure control to eight pounds, and  locked his helmet."Nice job, Johnny. Let's button  up. You with us, Guns?"Garrity sounded lazy as a well-fed  tiger.  "Ah'm with yew, cap'n."Coulter advanced the throttle to  5 G's.  And with the hiss of power,  SF 308 began the deadly, intricate,precarious maneuver called a combat  pass—a maneuver inherited from the  aerial dogfight—though it often turned  into something more like thebroadside duels of the old sailing  ships—as the best and least suicidal  method of killing a spaceship.  Tostart on the enemy's tail, just out of  his radar range.  To come up his track  at 2 mps relative velocity, firing six.30 caliber machine guns from fifty  miles out.  In the last three or four  seconds, to break out just enough toclear him, praying that he won't  break in the same direction.And to  keep on going.Four minutes and thirty-four seconds  to the break.Sixty seconds at  5 G's; one hundred ninety-two seconds  of free wheeling; and then, ifthey were lucky, the twenty-two frantic  seconds they were out here for—throwing  a few pounds of steel slugs  out before them in one unbrokenburst, groping out fifty miles into  the darkness with steel and radar fingers  to kill a duplicate of themselves.This is the worst.  These three minutesare the worst.One hundred  ninety-two eternal seconds of waiting,  of deathly silence and deathly  calm, feeling and hearing nothingbut the slow pounding of their own  heartbeats.  Each time he got back, it  faded away, and all he rememberedwas the excitement.  But each time  he went through it, it was worse.  Juststanding and waiting in the silence,  praying they weren't spotted—staring  at the unmoving firmament and  knowing he was a projectile hurtlingtwo miles each second straight at a  clump of metal and flesh that was  the enemy.  Knowing the odds weretwenty to one against their scoring  a kill... unless they ran into him.At eighty-five seconds, he corrected  slightly to center the pip.  The momentaryhiss of the rockets was a  relief.  He heard the muffled yammering  as Guns fired a short burstfrom the.30's standing out of their  compartments around the sides of the  ship.  They were practically recoilless,but the burst drifted him forward  against the cradle harness.And suddenly the waiting wasover.  The ship filled with vibration  as Guns opened up.Twenty-five seconds  to target.His eyes flicked fromthe sightscreen to the sky ahead,  looking for the telltale flare of rockets—ready  to follow like a ferret.There he is!At eighteen miles  from target, a tiny blue light flickeredahead.  He forgot everything but the  sightscreen, concentrating on keeping  the pip dead center.The guns hammered  on.  It seemed they'd been firing  for centuries.At ten-mile range,  the combat radar kicked the automatics  in, turning the ship ninety  degrees to her course in one and ahalf seconds.  He heard the lee side  firing cut out, as Garrity hung on  with two, then three guns.He held it as long as he could.   Closer than he ever had before.At  four miles he poured 12 G's for two  seconds.They missed ramming by something  around a hundred yards.  The  enemy ship flashed across his tail ina fraction of a second, already turned  around and heading up its own track,  yet it seemed to Paul he could make  out every detail—the bright red star,even the tortured face of the pilot.   Was there something lopsided in the  shape of that rocket plume, or washe just imagining it in the blur of  their passing?  And did he hear apingjust at that instant, feel the  ship vibrate for a second?He continued the turn in the directionthe automatics had started, bringing  his nose around to watch the  enemy's track.  And as the shape ofthe plume told him the other ship  was still heading back toward Earth,  he brought the throttle back up to  12 G's, trying to overcome the leadhis pass had given away.Guns spoke quietly to Johnson."Let me know when we kill his RV.   Ah may get another shot at him."And Johnny answered, hurt,  "What do you think I'm doing down  here—reading one of your magazines?"Paul was struggling with hundred-pound  arms, trying to focus the telescope  that swiveled over the panel.As the field cleared, he could see that  the plume was flaring unevenly, flickering  red and orange along one side.Quietly and viciously, he was talking  to himself.  "Blow! Blow!"And she blew.  Like a dirty raggedbit of fireworks, throwing tiny handfuls  of sparks into the blackness.   Something glowed red for a while,and slowly faded.There, but for the grace of God....Paul shuddered in a confused  mixture of relief and revulsion.He cut back to 4 G's, noting thatRVS registered about a mile per  second away from station, and suddenly  became aware that the red light  was on for loss of air.The cabin  pressure gauge read zero, and his  heart throbbed into his throat as he  remembered thatpingingsound, just  as they passed the enemy ship.  Hetold Garrity to see if he could locate  the loss, and any other damage, and  was shortly startled by a low amazed  whistle in his earphones."If Ah wasn't lookin' at it, Ah  wouldn't believe it.  Musta been oneof his shells went right around the  fuel tank and out again, without hittin'  it.  There's at least three inches oftank on a line between the holes!  He  musta been throwin' curves at us.Man, cap'n, this is our lucky day!"Paul felt no surprise, only relief  at having the trouble located.The  reaction to the close call might not  come till hours later.  "This kind ofluck we can do without.  Can you  patch the holes?""Ah can patch the one where it  came in, but it musta been explodin'  on the way out.  There's a hole Ahcould stick mah head through.""That's a good idea."  Johnson wasnot usually very witty, but this was  one he couldn't resist."Never mind, Guns. A patch thatbig wouldn't be safe to hold air."They were about eighty thousand  miles out.  He set course for Earth at  about five and a half mps, whichJohnson calculated to bring them in  on the station on the "going away"  side of its orbit, and settled back for  the tedious two hours of free wheeling.For ten or fifteen minutes, the  interphone crackled with the gregariousness  born of recent peril, andgradually the ship fell silent as each  man returned to his own private  thoughts.Paul was wondering about the men  on the other ship—whether any of  them were still alive.  Eighty thousandmiles to fall.  That was a little  beyond the capacity of an emergency  rocket—about 2 G's for sixty seconds—evenif they had them.  What a  way to go home!  He wondered whathe'd do if it happened to him.  Would  he wait out his time, or just unlock  his helmet.Guns' drawl broke into his reverie.   "Say, cap'n, Ah've been readin' inthis magazine about a trick they used  to use, called skip bombin'.  They'd  hang a bomb on the bottom of oneof these airplanes, and fly along the  ground, right at what they wanted  to hit.  Then they'd let the bomb goand get out of there, and the bomb  would sail right on into the target.   You s'pose we could fix this buggyup with an A bomb or an H bomb  we could let go a few hundred miles  out?  Stick a proximity fuse on it, anda time fuse, too, in case we missed.   Just sittin' half a mile apart and  tradin' shots like we did on that lastmission is kinda hard on mah nerves,  and it's startin' to happen too often.""Nice work if we could get it.I'm not crazy about those broadside  battles myself. You'd think they'd  have found something better than  these thirty caliber popguns by now,but the odds say we've got to throw  as many different chunks of iron as  we can, to have a chance of hitting  anything, and even then it's twentyto one against us.  You wouldn't have  one chance in a thousand of scoring  a hit with a bomb at that distance,even if they didn't spot it and take  off.  What you'd need would be a  rocket that could chase them, withthe bomb for a head.  And there's no  way we could carry that size rocket,  or fire it if we could.Some day these  crates will come with men's rooms,  and we'll have a place to carry something  like that.""How big would a rocket like that  be?""Five, six feet, by maybe a foot.  Weigh at least three hundred  pounds."It was five minutes before Guns  spoke again.  "Ah been thinkin',  cap'n.With a little redecoratin', Ah  think Ah could get a rocket that size  in here with me. We could weld a  rail to one of the gun mounts thatwould hold it up to five or six G's.   Then after we got away from station,  Ah could take it outside and mountit on the rail.""Forget it, lad. If they ever caught  us pulling a trick like that, they'dhave us on hydroponic duty for the  next five years. They just don't want  us playing around with bombs, till  the experts get all the angles figuredout, and build ships to handle them.   And besides, who do you think will  rig a bomb like that, without anybodyfinding out?  And where do you think  we'd get a bomb in the first place?They don't leave those things lying  around.  Kovacs watches them like a  mother hen. I think he counts themtwice a day.""Sorry, cap'n.  Ah just figured ifyou could get hold of a bomb, Ah  know a few of the boys who could  rig the thing up for us and keep  their mouths shut.""Well, forget about it. It's not a  bad idea, but we haven't any bomb.""Right, cap'n."But it was Paul who couldn't forget  about it.  All the rest of the way  back to station, he kept seeing visionsof a panel sliding aside in the nose  of a sleek and gleaming ship, while  a small rocket pushed its deadly snout  forward, and then streaked off attremendous acceleration.Interrogation was brief.  The missionhad turned up nothing new.   Their kill made eight against seven  for Doc Miller's crew, and they madesure Miller and the boys heard about  it.  They were lightheaded with the  elation that followed a successfulmission, swapping insults with the  rest of the squadron, and reveling in  the sheer contentment of being back  safe.It wasn't until he got back to his  stall, and started to write his father  a long overdue letter, that he rememberedhe had heard Kovacs say he  was going on leave.When he finished the letter, heopened the copy of "Lady Chatterley's  Lover" he had borrowed from  Rodriguez's limited but colorful library.He couldn't keep his mind on  it.  He kept thinking of the armament  officer.Kovacs was a quiet, intelligent kid,  devoted to his work.  Coulter wasn'ttoo intimate with him.  He wasn't a  spaceman, for one thing.  One of thoseillogical but powerful distinctions  that sub-divided the men of the station.   And he was a little too polite tobe easy company.Paul remembered the time he had  walked into the Muroc Base Officer'sClub with Marge Halpern on his  arm.  The hunger that had lain undisguised  on Kovacs' face the momenthe first saw them.  Marge was  a striking blonde with a direct manner,  who liked men, especially orbitstation men.  He hadn't thought about  the incident since then, but the look  in Kovacs' eyes kept coming back tohim as he tried to read.He wasn't sure how he got there,  or why, when he found himself walkinginto Colonel Silton's office to ask  for the leave he'd passed up at his  fiftieth mission.  He'd considered takingit several times, but the thought  of leaving the squadron, even for a  couple of weeks, had made him feel  guilty, as though he were quitting.Once he had his papers, he started  to get excited about it.  As he cleanedup his paper work and packed his  musette, his hands were fumbling,  and his mind was full of Sylvia.The vastness of Muroc Base was as  incredible as ever.Row on uncounted  row of neat buildings, each resting at  the top of its own hundred-yard  deep elevator shaft.A pulsing, throbbing  city, dedicated to the long slow  struggle to get into space and stay  there.The service crew eyed them  with studied indifference, as they  writhed out of the small hatch and  stepped to the ground.They drew a  helijet at operations, and headed immediately  for Los Angeles.Kovacs had been impressed when  Paul asked if he'd care to room together  while they were on leave.  Hewas quiet on the flight, as he had  been on the way down, listening contentedly,  while Paul talked combat  and women with Bob Parandes, anotherpilot going on leave.They parked the helijet at Municipal  Field and headed for the publicPV booths, picking up a coterie of  two dogs and five assorted children  on the way.  The kids followed quietlyin their wake, ecstatic at the sight of  their uniforms.Paul squared his shoulders, as befitteda hero, and tousled a couple of  uncombed heads as they walked.  The  kids clustered around the booths, asKovacs entered one to locate a hotel  room, and Paul another, to call  Sylvia."Honey, I've been so scared you  weren't coming back.  Where are you?  When will I see you? Why didn'tyou write?..."  She sputtered to a  stop as he held up both hands in  defense."Whoa, baby. One thing at a time.  I'm at the airport. You'll see me tonight,  and I'll tell you the rest then.That is, if you're free tonight.  And  tomorrow.And the day after, and  the day after that.  Are you free?"Her hesitation was only momentary.   "Well, I was going out—with  a girl friend.But she'll understand.  What's up?"He took a deep breath."I'd like  to get out of the city for a few days,  where we can take things easy and  be away from the crowds.And there  is another guy I'd like to bring  along.""We could take my helijet out to  my dad's cottage at—What did you  say?"It was a ticklish job explaining  about Kovacs, but when she understood  that he just wanted to do a  friend a favor, and she'd still havePaul all to herself, she calmed down.   They made their arrangements quickly,  and switched off.He hesitated a minute before he  called Marge.  She was quite a dishto give up.  Once she'd seen him with  Sylvia, he'd be strictlypersona non  grata—that was for sure.  It was an  unhappy thought.Well, maybe it was  in a good cause.  He shrugged and  called her.She nearly cut him off when she  first heard his request, but he did  some fast talking.The idea of several  days at the cottage intrigued her, and  when he described how smitten  Kovacs had been, she brightened upand agreed to come.  He switched off,  adjusted the drape of his genuine  silk scarf, and stepped out of thebooth.Kovacs and the kids were waiting.The armament officer had apparently  been telling them of Paul's exploits.   They glowed with admiration.The  oldest boy, about eleven, had true  worship in his eyes.  He hesitated amoment, then asked gravely:  "Would  you tell us how you kill a Red, sir?"Paul eyed the time-honored weapon  that dangled from the youngster's  hand.  He bent over and tapped itwith his finger.  His voice was warm  and confiding, but his eyes were far  away."I think next we're going to try  a slingshot," he said.THE ENDTranscriber's Note:This etext was produced fromAstounding Science Fiction      November 1955.Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.
