Story:
Pied Piper of MarsBy FREDERIC ARNOLD KUMMER, Jr.Elath Taen made mad music for the men of Mars.The red planet lived and would die to the      soul-tearing tunes of his fiendish piping.In all the solar system there is no city quite like Mercis, capital  of Mars.  Solis, on Venus, is perhaps more beautiful, some cities ofEarth certainly have more drive and dynamitism, but there is a strange  inscrutable air about Mercis which even terrestials of twenty years'  residence cannot explain.  Outwardly a tourists' mecca, with whiteplastoid buildings, rich gardens, and whispering canals, it has another  and darker side, ever present, ever hidden.  While earthmen work and  plan, building, repairing, bringing their vast energy and progressto decadent Mars, the silent little reddies go their devious ways,  following ancient laws which no amount of terrestial logic can shake.   Time-bound ritual, mysterious passions and hates, torturous, deviouslogic ... all these, like dark winding underground streams run beneath  the tall fair city that brings such thrilled superlatives to the lips  of the terrestial tourists.Steve Ranson, mounting the steps of the old house facing the Han  canal, was in no mood for the bizarre beauties of Martian scenery.  For  one thing, Mercis was an old story to him; his work with TerrestialIntelligence had brought him here often in the past, on other strange  cases.  And for another thing, his mission concerned more vital matters.Jared Haller, as head of the state-owned Martian Broadcasting System,  was next in importance to the august Governor Winship himself.  As  far back as the Hitlerian wars on earth it had been known that hewho controls propaganda, controls the nation ... or planet.  Martian  Broadcasting was an important factor in controlling the fierce warlike  little reddies, keeping the terrestial-imposed peace on the redplanet.  And when Jared Haller sent to Earth for one of the Terrestial  Intelligence, that silent efficient corps of trouble-shooters,  something was definitely up.The house was provided with double doors as protection against the  sudden fierce sandstorms which so often, in the month of Tol, sweep  in from the plains of Psidis to engulf Mercis in a red choking haze.Ranson passed the conventional electric eye and a polite robot voice  asked his name.  He gave it, and the inner door opened.A smiling little Martian butler met him in the hall, showed him into  Haller's study.  The head of M.B.C. stood at one end of the big library,the walls of which were lined with vivavox rolls and old-fashioned  books.  As Ranson entered, he swung about, frowning, one hand dropping  to a pocket that bulged unmistakably."Ranson, Terrestial Intelligence."  The special agent offered his card."You sent to Earth a while ago for an operator?"Jared Haller nodded.  He was a big, rough-featured individual with grayleonine hair.  A battering-ram of a man, one would think, who hammered  his way through life by sheer force and drive.  But as Ranson lookedcloser, he could see lines of worry, of fear, etched about the strong  mouth, and a species of terror within the shaggy-browed eyes."Yes," said Jared Haller."I sent for an operator. You got here  quickly, Mr. Ranson!""Seven days out of earth on the express-linerArrow."  Ranson wondered  why Haller didn't come to the point.Even Terrestial Intelligence  headquarters in New York hadn't known why a T.I. man was wanted on  Mars ... but Haller was one of the few persons sufficiently important  to have an operator sent without explanation as to why he was wanted.Ranson put it directly.  "Why did you require the help of T.I., Mr.  Haller?" he asked."Because we're up against something a little too big for the Mercian  police force to handle."  Jared Haller's strong hands tapped nervouslyupon the desk.  "No one has greater respect for our local authorities  than myself.  Captain Maxwell is a personal friend of mine.But I  understood that T.I. men had the benefit of certain amazing devices,  remarkable inventions, which make it easy for them to track down  criminals."Ranson nodded.  That was true.  T.I. didn't allow its secret devicesto be used by any other agency, for fear they might become known to  the criminals and outlaws of the solar system.  But Haller still hadn't  told what crime had taken place.This time Ranson applied the spur of  silence.  It worked."Mr. Ranson," Haller leaned forward, his face a gray grim mask,  "someone, something, is working to gain control of the Martian  Broadcasting Company!  And I don't have to tell you that whoevercontrols M.B.C. controls Mars!  Here's the set-up!  Our company, although  state owned, is largely free from red-tape, so long as we stress thegood work we terrestials are doing on Mars and keep any revolutionary  propaganda off the air-waves.  Except for myself, and half a dozen other  earthmen in responsible positions, our staff is largely Martian.That's in line with our policy of teaching Mars our civilization until  it's ready for autonomy.  Which it isn't yet, by quite some.As you  know."Ranson nodded, eyes intent as the pattern unfolded."All right."  Haller snapped.  "You see the situation.Remove us... the  few terrestials at the top of M.B.C... and Martian staff would carry  on until new men came out from Earth to take our places.  But supposeduring that period with no check on their activities, they started  to dish out nationalist propaganda?  One hour's program, with the old  Martian war-songs being played and some rabble-rouser yelling 'downwith the terrestial oppressors' and there'd be a revolution.  Millions  of reddies against a few police, a couple of regiments of the Foreign  Legion.It'd be a cinch.""But,"...  Ranson frowned..."this is only an interesting supposition.  The reddies are civilized, peaceful.""Outwardly," Haller snapped."But what do you or any other earthmen  know about what goes on in their round red heads?  And the proof that  some revolt is planned lies in what's been happening the past fewweeks! Look here!"  Haller bent forward, the lines about his mouth  tighter than ever.  "Three weeks ago my technical advisor, Rawlins,committed suicide.  Not a care in the world, but he killed himself.  A  week later Harris, head of the television department, went insane.Declared a feud with the whole planet, began shooting at everyone he  saw.  The police rayed him in the struggle.The following week Pegram,  the musical director, died of a heart attack.  Died with the most  terrorized expression on his face I've ever seen.Fear, causing the  heart attack, his doctor said.  You begin to see the set-up?  Three men,each a vital power in M.B.C. gone within three weeks!  And who's next?  Who?"  Jared Haller's eyes were bright with fear."Suicide, insanity, heart attack."  Ranson shrugged.  "All perfectlynormal. Coincidence that they should happen within three weeks.  What  makes you think there's been foul play?"For a long brittle moment Jared Haller stared out at the graceful white  city, wan in the light of the twin moons.  When he turned to face  Ranson again, his eyes were bleak as a lunar plain."One thing," he said slowly.  "The music.""Music?"  Ranson echoed.  "Look here, Mr. Haller, you....""It's all right."  Jared Haller grinned crookedly.  "I'm not insane. Yet.Look, Mr. Ranson!  There's just one clue to these mysterious deaths!   And that's the music!In each instance the servants told of hearing,  very faintly, a strange melody.  Music that did queer things to them,  even though they could hear it only vaguely.Music like none they'd  ever heard.  Like the devil's pipes,  playing on their souls, while....Almighty God!"Jared Haller froze, his face gray as lead, his eyes blue horror.Ranson  was like a man in a trance, bent forward, lips pressed tight until they  resembled a livid scar.  The room was silent as a tomb; outside, theycould hear the vague rumbling of the city, with the distant swish of  canal boats, the staccato roar of rockets as some earth-bound freighter  leaped from the spaceport.  Familiar, homey sounds, these, but beneaththem, like an undercurrent of madness, ran the macabre melody.There was, there had never been, Ranson knew, any music like this.   It was the pipes of Pan, the chant of robots,  the crying of souls intorment.  It was a cloudy purple haze that engulfed the mind,  it was a  silver knife plucking a cruel obligato on taut nerves,it was a thin  dark snake writhing its endless coils into the room.Neither man moved.Ranson knew all the tricks of visual hypnotism, the  whirling mirror, the waving hands, the pool of ink ... but this was  the hypnotism of sound.  Louder and clearer the music sounded, in eerieovertones, quavering sobbing minors, fierce reverberating bass.  Sharp  shards of sound pierced their ears, deep throbbing underrhythm shook  them as a cat shakes a mouse."God!"  Haller snarled.  "What... what is it?""Don't know."  Ranson felt a queer irritation growing within him.  Hestrode stiffly to the window, peered out.  In the darkness, the broad  Han canal lay placid;  the stars caught in its jet meshes gentlydrifted toward the bank, shattered on the white marble.  Along the  embankment were great fragrant clumps offayehbushes.  It was among  these, he decided, that their unknown serenader lay concealed.Suddenly the elfin melody changed.  Fierce, harsh, it rose, until Ranson  felt as though a file were rasping his nerves.  He knew that he shoulddash down, seize the invisible musician below ...  but logic, facts and  duty, all were fading from his mind.  The music was a spur, goading himto wild unreasoning anger.  The red mists of hate swirled through his  brain,  a strange unreasoning bloodlust grew with the savage beat of thewild music.  Berserk rage sounded in each shivering note and Ranson felt  an insane desire to run amok.  To inflict pain, to see red blood flow,to kill... kill!  Blindly he whirled,  groping for his gun,as the music  rose in a frenzied death-wail.Turning, Ranson found himself face to face with Jared Haller.But the  tall flinty magnate was now another person.  Primitive, atavistic rage  distorted his features, insane murder lurked in his eyes.The music was  his master, and it was driving him to frenzy.  "Kill!" the weird rhythm  screamed,"Kill!"  And Jared Haller obeyed.  He snatched the flame-gun  from his pocket, levelled it at Ranson.Whether it was the deadly melody outside, or the instinct of  self-preservation, Ranson never knew,  but he drove at Haller with grimfury.  The flame-gun hissed, filling the room with a greenish glare,  its  beam passing so close to Ranson's hair as to singe it.Ranson came up,  grinning furiously, and in a moment both men were struggling,  teeth  bared in animalistic grins, breath coming in choked gasps, whirlingin a mad dance of death as the macabre music distilled deadly poison  within their brains.The end came with startling suddenness.Ranson, twisting his opponent's  arm back, felt the searing blast of the flame-gun past his hand.  Jared  Haller, a ghastly blackened corpse, toppled to the floor.At that moment the lethal rhythm outside changed abruptly.  From the  fierce maddening beat of a few minutes before, the chords took on ayearning seductive tone.  A call, it seemed, irresistible, soft, with  a thousand promises.  This was the song the sirens sang to Ulysses,the call of the Pied Piper, the chant of the houris in paradise.  It  conjured up pictures in Ranson's mind ...pictures of fairyland,  of  exquisitely beautiful scenes,  of women lovely beyond imagination.All  of man's hopes,  man's dreams,  were in that music,and it drew Ranson as  a moth is drawn to a flame.  The piping of Pan, the fragile fantasies of  childhood,the voices of those beyond life....  Ranson walked stiffly  toward the source of the music, like a man drugged.As he approached the window the melody grew louder.  The hypnotism of  sound, he knew,  but he didn't care.It was enthralling, irresistible.   Like a sleepwalker he climbed to the sill,  stood outlined in the tallwindow.  Twenty feet to the ground, almost certain death ...  but Ranson  was lost in the golden world that the elfin melody conjured up.He  straightened his shoulders, was about to step out.Then suddenly there was a roar of atomic motors, a flashing of lights.A police boat, flinging up clouds of spray,  swept up the canal,  stopped.Ranson shook himself, like a man awakening from a nightmare,   saw uniformed figures leaping to the bank.  From the shadow of thefayehbushes a slight form sprang,  dodged along the embankment.Flame-guns cut the gloom but the slight figure swung to the left,  disappeared among the twisting narrow streets.  Bathed in cold sweat,Ranson stepped back into the room, where the still,  terrible form of  Jared Haller lay.  Ranson stared at it, as though seeing it for thefirst time.  Outside, there were pounding feet;  the canal-patrolmen  raced through the house, toward the study.And then, his brain weary as  if it had been cudgelled,  Ranson slid limply to the floor.Headquarters of the Martian Canal-Patrol was brilliantly lighted by a  dozen bigastraluxarcs.  Captain Maxwell chewed at his gray mustache,  staring curiously at Ranson."Then you admit killing Haller?" he demanded."Yes."Ranson nodded sombrely.  "In the struggle.  Self-defense.  But evenif it hadn't been self-defense, I probably would have fought with him.   That music was madness, I tell you!  Madness! Nobody's responsible whenunder its influence! I....""You killed Haller," Captain Maxwell said.  "And you blame it on thisalleged music. I might believe you, Ranson, but how many other people  would?  Even members of Terrestial Intelligence aren't sacro sanct. I'll  have to hold you for trial.""Hold me for trial?"  Ranson leaned forward, his gaunt face intent."While the real killer, the person playing that music, gets away? Look!  Let me out of here for twelve hours! That's all I ask!  And if I don't  track down whoever was outside Haller's house, you can....""Sorry."  Captain Maxwell shook his head.  "You know I'd like to, Ranson.But this is murder.  To let a confessed murderer, even though he is a  T.I. man, go free, is impossible."The captain drew a deep breath,  motioned to the two gray-uniformed patrolmen.  "Take Mr. Ranson."And then Steve Ranson went into action.  In one blinding burst of  speed, he lunged across the desk, tore Captain Maxwell's pistol from  its holster.Before the captain and the two patrolmen knew what had  happened, they were staring into the ugly muzzle of the flame-gun."Sorry."Ranson said tightly.  "But it had to be done.  There's hell  loose on Mars, the devil's melody!And it's got to be stopped before it  turns this planet upside down!""You can't get away with this, Ranson!"Captain Maxwell shook his head.   "It'll only make it tougher for you when we nab you again! Be sensible!  Put down that gun.""No good. Got to work fast."  Ranson backed toward the door, gun  in hand."Let this mad music go unchecked and it's death to all  terrestials on Mars!  And I'm going to stop it! So long, captain! You  can try me for murder if you want, after I've done my job here!"Ranson took the key from the massive plastic door as he backed  through the entrance.  Once in the hall, he slammed the door shut,locked Maxwell and his men in the room.  Then, dropping the gun into  his pocket, he ran swiftly down the corridor to the main entrance of  headquarters.In the hall a patrolman glanced at him suspiciously,  halted him, but a wave of Ranson's T.I. card put the man aside.Free of headquarters, Ranson began to run.Only a few moments, he  knew, before Maxwell and his men blasted a way to freedom, set out in  pursuit.  Like a lean gray shadow Ranson ran, twisting, dodging, amongthe narrow streets, heading toward Haller's house.  Mercis was a dream  city in the wan light of the moons.  One in either side of the heavens,they threw weird double shadows across the rippling canals, the aimless  streets.  Sleek canal-cabs roared along the dark waterways, throwing  up clouds of spray, and on the embankments, green-eyed, bulge-headedlittle reddies padded, silent, inscrutable,  themselves a part of the  eternal mystery of Mars.Haller's house stood dark and brooding beside the canal.  Captain  Maxwell's men had completed their examination and the place was  deserted.Ranson stepped into the shadow of the clump of fragrant       fayehbushes,  where the unknown musician had stood; there was littledanger, he felt, of patrolmen hunting for him at Haller's house.   The captain had little faith in copybook maxims about the murderer  returning to the scene of the crime.Ranson stood motionless for a moment as a canal boat swept by, then  drew from his pocket a heavy black tube.  He tugged, and it extendedtelescopically to a cane some four feet long.  The cane was hollow, a  tube, and the head of it was large as a man's two fists and covered  with small dials, gauges.This was the T.I.'s most cherished secret,  the famous "electric bloodhound," by which criminals could be tracked.Ranson touched a lever and a tiny electric motor in the head of thecane hummed, drawing air up along the tube.  He tapped the bank where  the unknown musician had stood, eyes on the gauges.  Molecules ofmatter, left by the mysterious serenader, were sucked up the tube,  registered on a sensitive plate, just as delicate color shades register  on the plate of a color camera.Ranson tapped the cane carefully upon the ground, avoiding those places  where he had stood.  Few people crossed this overgrown embankment, and  it was a safe bet that no one other than the strange musician hadbeen there recently.  The scent was a clear one, and the dials on the  head of the cane read R-2340-B, the numerical classification of the  tiny bits of matter left behind by the unknown.The theory behind it  was quite simple.  The T.I. scientists had reasoned that the sense of  smell is merely the effect of suspended molecules in the air actingupon sensitive nerve filaments, and they knew that any normal human  can follow a trail of some strong odor such as perfumes, or gasoline,  while animals, possessing more sensitive perceptions, can follow  less distinct trails.To duplicate this mechanically had proven more  difficult than an electric eye or artificial hearing device, but in  the end they had triumphed.  Their efforts had resulted in the machineRanson now carried.The trial was, at the start, clear.  Ranson tapped the long tube on theground like a blind man, eyes on the dial.  Along the embankment, into a  side street, he made his way.  There were few abroad in this old quarterof the city; from the spaceport came the roar of freighters, the rumble  of machinery, but here in the narrow winding streets there was only the  faint murmur of voices behind latticed windows, the rustle of the wind,  the rattle of sand from the red desert beyond the city.As Ranson plunged further into the old Martian quarter, the trail grewmore and more confused, crossed by scores of other trails left by  passersby.  He was forced to stop, cast about like a bloodhound, tapping  every square foot of the street before the R-2340-B on the dial showedthat he had once more picked up the faint elusive scent.Deeper and deeper Ranson plunged into the dark slums of Mercis.  Smokygambling dens, dives full of drunken spacehands and slim red-skinned  girls, maudlin singing ... even the yellow glare of the forbidden  san-rays, as they filtered through drawn windows.  Unsteady figures madetheir way along the streets.  Mighty-thewed Jovian blasters, languid  Venusians, boisterous earthmen ... and the little Martians padding  softly along, wrapped in their loose dust-robes.At the end of an alley where the purple shadows lay like stagnant  pools, Ranson paused.  The alley was a cul-de-sac, which meant thatthe person he was trailing must have entered one of the houses.  Very  softly he tapped the long tube on the ground.  Again with a hesitantswinging of dials, R-2340-B showed up, on the low step in front of one  of the dilapidated, dome-shaped houses.  Ranson's eyes narrowed.  So theperson who had played the mad murder melody had entered that house!   Might still be there!  Quickly he telescoped the "electric bloodhound,"dropped it into his pocket, and drew his flame-gun.The old house was dark, with an air of morbid deadly calm about  it.Ranson tried the door, found it locked.  A quick spurt from his  flame-gun melted the lock; he glanced about to make sure no one had  observed the greenish glare, then stepped inside.The hallway was shadowy, its walls hung with ancient Martian tapestries  which, from their stilted symbolic ideographs must have dated back to  the days of the Canal-Builders.At the end of the hallway, however,  light jetted through a half-open door.  Ranson moved toward it, silent  as a phantom, muscles tense.Gripping his flame-gun, he pushed the door  wide...  and a sudden exclamation broke from his lips.Before him lay a gleaming laboratory, lined with vials of strange  liquids, shining test-tubes, and queer apparatus.  Beside a table,  pouring a black fluid from a beaker into a test-tube, stood a man.Half-terrestial, half-Martian, he seemed, with the large hairless head  of the red planet, and the clean features of an earthman.  His eyes,behind their glasses, were like green ice, and the hand pouring the  black fluid did not so much as waver at Ranson's entrance.Ranson gasped.The bizarre figure was that of Dr. Elath Taen,  master-scientist, sought by the T.I. for years, in vain!  Elath Taen,  outlaw and renegade, whose sole desire was the extermination of allterrestials on Mars, a revival of the ancient glories of the red  planet.  The tales told about him were fabulous; and this was the man  behind the unholy music!"Good evening, Mr. Ranson," Elath Taen smiled.  "Had I known T.I.  men were on Mars I should have taken infinitely more precautions.However...."As he spoke, his hand moved suddenly, as though to hurl the test tubeat Ranson.  Quick as he was, the T.I. man was quicker.  A spurt of  flame leapt from his gun, shattering the tube.The dark liquid hissed,  smoking, on to the floor."Well done, Mr. Ranson."Elath Taen nodded calmly.  "Had the acid struck  you, it would have rendered you blind.""That's about enough of your tricks!"  Ranson grated.  "Come along, Dr.  Taen! We're going to headquarters!""Since you insist."  Elath Taen removed his chemist's smock, began, very  deliberately, to strip off his rubber gloves."Quit stalling!"  Ranson snapped.  "Get going! I...."The words faded on  the T.I. man's lips.  Faintly, in the distance, came the strains of  soft eerie music!"Good God!"  Ranson's eyes darted about the laboratory.  "That... that'sthe same as Haller and I....""Exactly, Mr. Ranson."  Elath Taen smiled thinly."Listen!"The music was a caress, soft as a woman's skin.  Slow, drowsy, likethe hum of bees on a hot summer's afternoon.  Soothing, soporific, in  dreamy, crooning chords.  A lullaby, that seemed to hang lead weightsupon the eyelids.  Audible hypnotism, as potent as some drug.  Clearer  with each second, the melody grew, coming nearer and nearer thelaboratory."Come... come on," Ranson said thickly.  "Got to get out of here."But his words held no force, and Elath Taen was nodding sleepily under  the influence of the weird dream-music.  Ranson knew he should act,swiftly, while he could; but the movement of a single muscle seemed  an intolerable effort.  His skin felt as though it were being rubbed  with velvet, a strange purring sensation filled his brain.He tried to  think, to move, but his will seemed in a padded vise.  The music was  dragging him down, down, into the gray mists of oblivion.Across the laboratory Elath Taen had slumped to the floor, a vague  smile of triumph on his face.  Ranson turned to the direction ofthe music, tried to raise his gun, but the weapon slipped from his  fingers, he fell to his knees.  Sleep... that was all that mattered...  sleep.The music was like chloroform, its notes stroked his brain.   Through half-shut eyes he saw a door at the rear of the laboratory  open, saw a slim, dark, exotic girl step through into the room.Slung  about her neck in the manner of an accordian, was a square box, with  keys studding its top.  For a long moment Ranson stared at the dark,enigmatic girl, watched her hands dance over the keys to produce the  soft lulling music.  About her head, he noticed, was a queer copper  helmet, of a type he had never before seen.And then the girl, Elath  Taen, the laboratory, all faded into a kaleidoscopic whirl.  Ranson felt  himself falling down into the gray mists, and consciousness disappeared.... [The rest of the story is omitted]
