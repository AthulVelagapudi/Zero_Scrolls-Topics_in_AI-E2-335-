Introduction   The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the 1996 welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-193 ).It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs.  The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children—specifically, those headed by single mothers—that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s.  The 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. the legislative activity on TF since been to program funding and financing authority for.   of extensions not changeF, though were in extensions in, and.  The TANF Extension Act of 2019 ( P.L. 116-4 ) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.This report will begin with a brief overview of the history of the AFDC program and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s.  That overview will be followed by a summary of the 1996 welfare reform law and the changes made since 1996.  The report concludes with a detailed chronology of TANF legislation.Brief History of AFDC and the Welfare Reform DebatesThe modern form of cash assistance for needy families with children dates back to the Progressive Era of the early 1900s, and state- or locally funded mothers' pensions for "fatherless" families.  The purpose of these programs was to permit these mothers to stay at home and care for their children.   Federal funding for these programs was first provided in the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) through the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, later renamed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC).Many the later changes, the welfare reform debates thes, on of and whether providing cash toworking mothers asives for both.    the the ADC program touched other of the of.  DC provided federal for, medical, child care, and foster care.These were later spun off into separate programs, with dedicated federal funding.  While much of the focus of the welfare reform debates was on the single mother (custodial parent), ADC/AFDC policy also touched on noncustodial parents.  The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program was created, in great part, to reimburse states and the federal government for the costs of providing assistance to single mothers, and making noncustodial fathers responsible for these costs.  CSE has evolved into a program that distributes child support payments collected from noncustodial parents to custodial parents, mostly to families that have never received or are no longer receiving cash assistance.The Early Years:  1930s to mid-1950sThe Security Act 1935 (-) the insurance programs of Age Benefits and compensation, where workers earned protection against wages of age and.   created federal for state programs providing assistance forincome aged, blind persons, and programs for needy families with children where one parent (usually the father) was unable to support the family.The ADC program provided to the to help finance programs to assist children were " of parental support care of the, absence or parent" and who lived with the or.  States program and determined eligibility for its benefits.  The federal government provided funding for a portion of the expenditures made in state ADC programs.The legislative history of the 1935 act explicitly stated that the purpose of ADC payments was to permit mothers to stay at home rather than work:  The very phrases "mothers' aid" and "mothers' pensions" place an emphasis equivalent to misconstruction of the intention of these laws. are not primarily to mothers but defense measures for.   are to release thening role the person whose to give her the andatehip necessary not to them from into social but more to into citizens capable of contributing to society.   The 1935 Social Security Act left administration and many decisions about eligibility to the states.States also determined ADC benefit amounts.  In the early years, families receiving ADC benefits were often headed by a widow or had a disabled father.  However, over time the natures of both the program and the families it aided changed.The Social Security Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379) added "survivor" benefits to the program of old age benefits, renaming it Old Age and Survivors Insurance.  Survivor benefits, like old age benefits, were social insurance benefits earned through work in a covered job and paid to spouses and children upon the death of a worker or retiree.  This provided an alternative, and more universal, means of aiding widows and their children.  The Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-881) added Disability Insurance to Old Age and Survivor Insurance, with the combined program now commonly referred to as Social Security.The 1956 amendments also expanded the types of jobs covered by Social Security.  These changes, too, provided more universal means of aiding the types of families that were originally assisted by ADC.  The families receiving ADC increasingly were families where the father was alive but absent.The caseload also became increasingly nonwhite.  		 The mid-1950s to the 1960s:Self-Sufficiency and Work   The issue of whether single mothers should work was also much debated.The intent of ADC to allow single mothers to stay home and raise their children was often met with resistance at the state and local levels.  It was also contrary to the reality that low-income women, particularly women of color, were sometimes expected to, and often did, work.  Further, the increase in women's labor force participation in the second half of the 20 th century—particularly among married white women—eroded support for payments that permitted single mothers to remain at home and out of the workforce.The Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-881) added the goals of creating "self-sufficiency" and strengthening family life to ADC, along with funding for services that would seek to achieve these goals.   P.L. 87-31, enacted in 1961, first made cash assistance benefits available to families headed by two able-bodied parents at state option.  This authority was temporary at first (in response to an economic downturn), but was later made permanent.In 1962, the program was renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children.  The 1962 amendments, the Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 (P.L. 87-543), also established a community work and training program for adult AFDC recipients, largely intended for men in two-parent families.  The Social Security Amendments of 1967 (P.L. 90-248) enacted both financial incentives for adult recipients to work and, for the first time, requirements for AFDC mothers to work.These amendments required states to disregard from a family's countable income some earnings when determining its "need" and benefits.  The amendments also created a new work program under AFDC—the Work Incentive Program (WIN)—that expanded the population served by an AFDC-related work program to women.The Late 1960s and 1970s:  Negative Income Tax and Guaranteed IncomesThe lates the welfare reform with proposals put to to completely replace a different.  This occurred asDC's costs and the number of families receiving its benefits increased.  In 1964, fewer than 1 million families received AFDC.  By 1973, the AFDC rolls had increased to 3.1 million families.For the decade in, these were the "negative") concept.IT proposals have a guaranteed income to families who had no earnings (the "income guarantee" that was part of these proposals).  For families with earnings, the NIT would have provided for a gradual reduction in the benefit as earnings increased.President Nixon proposed to replace with anIT program, the).  This proposal also would have nationalized the program, with the federal government paying the income guarantee and states able to supplement the federal guarantee with their own funds.  This legislation was not enacted; it passed the House twice but never passed the Senate.In 1972, the Senate Finance Committee proposed to guarantee jobs—rather than income—for parents of school-age children.  That proposal, too, did not ultimately pass.   President Carter also proposed an NIT-based cash assistance program coupled with a public service job program in 1977.President Carter's proposals died in committee (they were never reported to either the full House or Senate).  A less ambitious proposal from President Carter in 1979 passed the House but did not pass the Senate.The 1980s: Devolution and Early Experiments   The proposals to change AFDC made by President Reagan at the beginning of his Administration differed sharply from the earlier welfare reform proposals.They emphasized devolution to the states in decisionmaking, rather than nationalization.  They also emphasized requirement to work, rather than work incentives.  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) limited the earnings disregard that was enacted in 1967, ending benefits for many who were on the rolls and working.  It also gave states expanded authority to require recipients to engage in community service or work experience programs (unpaid work) in exchange for their AFDC benefit.In 1982, President Reagan proposed to completely devolve cash assistance for families with children.  That proposal did not pass.  In the 1980s, there was increasing attention to "welfare dependency."Research at that time showed that while many mothers were on cash assistance for a short period of time, a substantial minority of mothers remained on the rolls for long periods.  Additionally, policymakers began to focus on the possibility that a single mother who left welfare for work might be financially worse off than if she did not work and continued to collect benefits.  Such a single mother, who might command relatively low wages in the labor force, risked losing medical assistance from Medicaid for herself and her children and faced work-related costs such as child care.The Family Support Act of 1988 (-485 ) established inDC the of mutual responsibility the.  It created the Skills) Training which provided employment services, training forThe also states provide benefits for two families, though it was on more than for single-parent families.The Family Support Act also established the Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) program that continued Medicaid coverage for a period of time for those who otherwise would have lost eligibility for Medicaid when moving from welfare to work.  Further, it guaranteed child care for AFDC recipients engaged in work activities and provided time-limited (transitional) child care for those who left AFDC for work.  Subsequent legislation, enacted in 1990, further expanded child care by creating a new block grant for those without a connection to AFDC, new matching funds to subsidize child care for those "at risk" of receiving AFDC, and a major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).Additionally, an era of experimentation on "welfare-to-work" initiatives began in the 1980s.  President Reagan proposed legislation in 1987 that would have authorized states to conduct demonstration projects that could have included AFDC and any other low-income assistance programs.  These demonstrations would have been overseen at the federal level by an Interagency Low-Income Opportunity Board.  Though the proposed legislation was not enacted, the Reagan Administration, and subsequently the Administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, issued waivers of AFDC requirements under another provision of law.The experimentation on "welfare-to-work" initiatives found that requiring participation in work or job preparation activities could effectively move single mothers off the benefit rolls and into jobs.  		 1992 to 1996:"Ending Welfare As We Know It"   The number of families receiving cash assistance had been fairly stable during the period from 1982 to 1988.However, beginning in the summer of 1989 the number of families receiving cash assistance began to increase once again.  			 President Clinton's ProposalDuring the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Bill Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  He stressed time-limited aid and expanded financial supports for those who did go to work.The 1993 tax bill further expanded the EITC.   President Clinton made his welfare reform proposal in June 1994.  It would have phased in a two-year limit on AFDC receipt without work, followed by required participation in a wage-paying work program after two years.It would also have expanded funding for training within the first two years.  It was estimated to increase child care costs for participants in the JOBS program or the wage-paying work program.  The proposal would have barred AFDC to unwed minor mothers.President Clinton's proposal was never by. , the period the the 1996 reform, the Administration waivers ofDC to states to in "elfare" demonstration projects.  Some of these waivers were for small-scale demonstrations, but some were for statewide demonstrations of state-designed cash assistance and work programs.The Contract with America  Welfare reform was one of 10 legislative initiatives that was included in the "Contract with America," developed by Republicans for the 1994 congressional campaign.The welfare proposal in the Contract with America would have required recipients to work after two years of AFDC (like the Clinton Administration proposal), but it also would have imposed a lifetime five-year limit on benefits.  It would have barred AFDC to unwed minor mothers and would have imposed a "family cap," not increasing benefits for new babies born into AFDC families.  Funding for AFDC and child care would have been capped, with states given the option to receive AFDC as a block grant.A Block Grant for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  H.R. 4 , as introduced at the start of the 104 th Congress, was the Contract with America proposal.However, immediately following the 1994 congressional election, House Republicans worked with several Republican governors to craft an alternative proposal that would block grant funding for AFDC and other social programs.  The welfare reform legislation considered by House committees reflected the block grant proposals rather than the original H.R. 4 legislation.  Legislation reported from the House committees was bundled into an omnibus welfare reform bill that included the end of AFDC and its replacement with TANF.  That bill, the Personal Responsibility Act, substituting for the original text of H.R. 4 , passed the House on March 24, 1995.H.. 4, as House, for all later welfare reform bills considered by the 104.  It would have replacedDC and programs of Emergency, and the work training program for a states for Families; allottedF basic block grant funds to states based on recent expenditures in AFDC and related programs;allowed states to spend theirF on a of services;  ually phased in a that of the be or in activities, but the to count that  the requirement could met,, through reduction (., theoad reduction   a on cash assistance;prohibited unwed minor parents from receiving assistance;  hibited from increasing cash benefits when a new born to a family already on the rolls (the family cap);  and limited need-tested benefits for noncitizens in need-tested programs, including requiring that noncitizens be in the United States for five years before being eligible for TANF.The House-passed bill also consolidated AFDC-related child care funding with the block grant created in 1990, and it increased funding for child care.  However, it ended the guarantee that those transitioning from welfare-to-work be provided child care.  The Senate Finance Committee ordered H.R. 4 reported in May 1995.The Finance Committee bill adopted a similar structure to the House bill.  Different from the House bill, however, the Senate Finance Committee bill  would have continued a separate employment and training program; did not include a family cap; and did not include the prohibition on benefits to unwed minor parents.Disputes about the committee-reported measure over items such as the distribution of funds held up consideration of the bill until August and September of 1995.  Negotiations between party leaders in the Senate, Senator Robert Dole for the Republicans and Senator Thomas Daschle for the Democrats, produced an accord that also adopted the basic structure of the House bill but made some substantial modifications.  The compromise bill included a requirement that states continue to spend some of their own funds (a "maintenance of effort," or MOE requirement) in order to receive their full block grant funds; supplemental grants to states with high rates of population growth and/or low historical welfare spending per poor child; a contingency fund for states experiencing economic need; a provision to allow aid to unwed minor parents who were living in an adult supervised setting; and "charitable choice" provisions to permit increased participation of faith-based organizations in the delivery of welfare services.The Senate passed its version of H.R. 4 on September 19, 1995.Welfare Reform  Added to the 1995 Budget Bill—First Veto of Welfare ReformFollowing passage of welfare reform legislation in the Senate, both the House and Senate began the process of crafting legislation to implement the budget adopted for FY1996.  On October 17, 1995, the House Budget Committee reported its budget reconciliation bill ( H.R. 2491 ), which included the end of AFDC and its replacement with TANF.  It passed the House on October 26, 1995.  The Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill also generally included the Senate-passed version of the TANF proposal, and it passed on October 28, 1995.Conferees to the budget bill— theon November,.The House--approved conference agreement was vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995.  President Clinton's veto message highlighted his opposition to cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, the EITC, and child nutrition programs.  The President said:On welfare reform, I strongly support real welfare reform that strengthens families and encourages work and responsibility.  But the provisions in this bill, when added to the EITC cuts, would cut low-income programs too deeply.Final Agreement on H.R. 4 and Second Veto of Welfare ReformWith the veto of the budget reconciliation bill, attention turned toward finalizing House-Senate agreements on the stand-alone welfare reform bill ( H.R. 4 ).  A final conference report on H.R. 4 was filed on December 20, 1995.  The final agreement included many of the modifications to TANF that were adopted in the Senate, including a compromise maintenance of effort requirement; supplemental grants to states with high population growth and/or low historical spending per poor child, but with limited funding; and a state option to impose a family cap.President Clinton vetoed H.R. 4 on January 9, 1996.  In vetoing the bill, the President remarked:The final welfare reform legislation should provide sufficient child care to enable recipients to leave welfare to work; reward States for placing people in jobs; restore the guarantee of health coverage for poor families; require States to maintain their stake in moving people from welfare to work; and protect States and families in the event of economic downturn and population growth.  The President also objected to budget cuts not related to the TANF proposal, such as provisions that would have cut spending in food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), benefits for disabled children, benefits for noncitizens, school lunches, and foster care and adoption assistance.Legislation Action in 1996With welfare reform twice vetoed, the National Governor's Association (NGA) in February 1996 adopted a policy position asking for additional child care funds, additional contingency funds for recessionary periods, and bonus payments for states that meet certain employment outcomes.  In May 1996, House and Senate Republicans introduced bills that reflected the policies of the vetoed H.R. 4 and provided additional funding for child care, the TANF contingency fund, and performance bonuses.  H.R. 3734 , the budget reconciliation bill for that year, included these welfare reform provisions together with a proposal to revise Medicaid.H.. 3734 House on July, 1996.  The Senate made a key bill by dropping its MedicaidThe reform provisions remained in34, and it on July   conference agreement was filed July 1996; it passed the House on July 31, 1996, and the Senate on August 1, 1996.President Clinton signed the legislation, known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA; P.L. 104-193 ), into law on August 22, 1996.Major Differences Between AFDC and TANF   The 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC and some of its related programs and replaced it with the TANF block grant.ing the AFDC-related care was a separate stream care.  Some things did not change with the 1996 law.  As was the case with AFDC, TANF programs are run by states (and sometimes localities), and they determine the maximum benefits under the programs and set the income eligibility thresholds.Table 1 summarizes some of the major differences between AFDC and TANF.  It should be noted that at the time of enactment of the 1996 law many states were operating under waivers of the AFDC rules that related to cash assistance.  These waivers imposed time limits, set different rules for counting earnings than did the AFDC federal rules, and set different rules for work or participation in job activities.  TANF permitted states to continue programs operated under waivers, even if the provisions of the waiver were inconsistent with TANF rules.The last of these waivers expired in 2007.  	 Overview of Post-1996 TANF LegislationBalanced Budget Act of 1997The BalancedBA9733 ), enacted the 1996, made to.  It a program providing additional funding dedicated to financing work activities.  The Welfare-to-Work Grant program (WTW) provided $3 billion for two years, FY1998 and FY1999.Under the program, funding was divided, with 75% provided to states and local workforce areas through a formula and 25% dedicated to competitive grants.  The program was originally targeted at the hardest to serve population on TANF and similarly disadvantaged noncustodial parents.  The WTW grant program was administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), not the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which administers TANF.  Subsequent legislation relaxed requirements for targeting services to the hardest to serve, and as funds were spent more slowly than anticipated, the deadline for expenditures was extended.The BBA97 made several other to T including permitting a greater of be as work through, but a on counting such participation; setting a statutory limit on transfers from TANF to the Social Services Block Grant at 10%; and making technical corrections to the 1996 welfare reform bill, including technical corrections to TANF.Attempts at Reauthorization:  2002-2005In February 2002, President George W. Bush made proposals for the reauthorization of the TANF block grant and related welfare reform proposals.  The document, Working for Independence, outlined a five-year reauthorization that would have  funded the basic TANF block grant at the same level provided from FY1997 through FY2002 for an additional five years; provided mandatory child care funding through FY2007 at its FY2002 level (with no inflation or other adjustment over the period FY2003-FY2007); provided dedicated funding for grants to promote healthy marriage; raised the work participation standard to a minimum of 70% of families with a "work-eligible individual" that must be working or engaged in activities;required 40 hours per week of work or engagement in activities for full credit toward meeting the standard, but allowed for partial credit for hours less than 40 hours per week;  allowed states to count rehabilitative activities for three months on the rolls, but narrowed the activities that counted after three months to work or community service or work experience; and ended the caseload reduction credit against the work standards, replacing it with a credit for recipients who left the rolls for work.  The Bush Administration proposals were incorporated (with some modifications) into bills that passed the House in 2002 and 2003: H.R. 4737 (107 th Congress) and H.R. 4 (108 th Congress).A major difference between the Bush Administration proposal and the House proposals of 2002 and 2003 was that the House proposals retained the caseload reduction credit and provided extra credit to states that had large historical caseload reductions.  Following House action, the Senate Finance Committee reported substantially differing versions of each bill.  The Senate Finance Committee bills did not narrow the activities that could be counted toward the work participation standard after three months, and they expanded the ability of states to count participation in rehabilitative activities toward the TANF work participation standard.  The Senate Finance Committee bills would have replaced the caseload reduction credit with a credit based on employed leavers, families diverted from the rolls, and families receiving work supports.The full Senate never acted on either of the Senate Finance Committee-reported bills.  In the absence of reauthorization legislation, TANF program and funding authority was extended on a temporary basis 13 times from 2002 to 2006.The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005The early part of 2005 again saw committee action on legislation to reauthorize TANF.  On March 9, 2005, the Senate Finance Committee ordered reported legislation that became S. 667 (109 th Congress).  The following week, the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources considered H.R. 240 and sent it to the full committee.  However, further action on TANF reauthorization did not occur until the fall of 2005, when the House and Senate began considering legislation under the budget reconciliation process.The House passed as part of their reconciliation bill (the House amendment to S. 1932 ) the TANF reauthorization bills that essentially incorporated the proposals passed by the House in 2002 and 2003 and were contained in H.R. 240 .  The Senate version of the reconciliation bill contained no TANF provisions.The conference report the budget bill included TF provisions those that.The 2005 (RA171 ) included aterm ofF funding, through FY2010) the of bonuses states) the a $ million for and grants on andhood, with $ million year for marriage) toF work rules, as counting reduction only from 2005 ( than) the participation standards, requiring to define specific activities that may count for each listed and requiring that states verify activities of recipients.The included an in mandatory child funding $.7 billion per year to $2.917 billion per year.The conference report on the DRA passed the House on December 19, 2005.  Congress finished reconciling differences between the two chambers in February 2006.  President Bush signed the DRA into law as P.L. 109-171 on February 8, 2006.American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009The economy entered recession after, with a major crisis and accelerating job loss in.  In the 2009RA,5 ) passed signed Obama.  ARRA included tax cuts; unemployment insurance provisions; and extra funding for programs, including provisions to provide fiscal relief to states.ARRA also included $5 billion for a new TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) available to be spent in FY2009 and FY2010.  The ECF supplemented funding for the regular TANF contingency fund, which itself was depleted in early FY2010.  The ECF reimbursed states for 80% of the cost of increased expenditures for basic assistance, short-term emergency aid, and subsidized employment.  ARRA also temporarily froze the TANF caseload reduction credit at prerecession levels, through its application to the FY2011 work participation standards.TANF Legislation from 2010 to 2019Theterm of TF in theRA expired of FY2010 (). , Congress continuedF program authority through  F extensions been intogap resolutions or bills to fund all or the government, to, to unrelated or passed as stand-alone legislation.(As this,alone legislation represents enacted that addressed onlyF and programs.)   were two inF.  inged during broader " in October and December   were on unspent, previously appropriated TANF funds to finance their TANF activities during the shutdown.While many of the short-term extensions of TANF funding did not make changes to TANF policy, three extension laws did The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (CRA, P.L. 111-291 ), a bill to settle claims against the federal government for certain Indian tribes, included a TANF extension through the end of FY2011.  It also altered funding for the healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, splitting the combined $150 million appropriation for them at $75 million for healthy marriage and $75 million for responsible fatherhood (it had previously been $100 million for healthy marriage and $50 million for responsible fatherhood).Additionally, the CRA required special one-time reports from the states on how they spend funds and on individuals with no reported hours of work participation.  The CRA also provided funding for TANF supplemental grants only through June 30, 2011 (rather than September 30, 2011, the end of the fiscal year).  Supplemental grants were not funded for the last quarter of FY2011, nor any fiscal year thereafter.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) extended TANF through the end of FY2012, and also permanently amended TANF law to require states to act to prevent cash assistance recipients from withdrawing their benefits at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) at strip clubs, casinos, and liquor stores.The FY2017 Act (.- ) extended the TF grant for the and.   also financedrelated research through a of. of the TANF basic block grant appropriation.  This reduced the TANF basic block grant to each state by 0.33%.In 2018, the House Ways and Means Committee reported legislation ( H.R. 5861 , 115 th Congress) that would have reauthorized and funded TANF for five years; revised TANF's work rules to measure employment outcomes rather than participation; required all assistance recipients to have an individualized plan; required that all TANF funds be spent on families with incomes at or below 200% of poverty; and required a minimum percentage of TANF funds to be spent on assistance, work activities, or short-term economic aid.  The bill was not considered by the full House.Detailed Legislative Chronology  		1996P.L. 104-193 , enacted August 22, 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, established the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.  Funds for most TANF grants were appropriated through FY2002; supplemental grants and the TANF contingency fund were appropriated through FY2001.  States were required to implement TANF, and accept their block grant funding, by July 1, 1997, though they could opt to implement earlier.P.L. 104-327 , enacted October 19, 1996, amended the transition rule from the pre-TANF programs to TANF that limited total FY1997 federal funding for TANF and pre-TANF programs.  It changed the limit on funding to the states for FY1997 from an amount equal to their basic block grant to an amount equal to their basic block grant plus, if they qualified, what they would have received from the TANF contingency fund.1997  P.L. 105-33 , enacted August 5, 1997, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, raised the cap limiting the counting of education as work from 20% to 30% of those considered engaged in work, and temporarily removed from that cap teen parents engaged in education through FY1999;  set the maximum allowable TANF transfer to Title XX social services at 10% of the block grant (rather than one-third of total transfers); and made technical corrections to P.L. 104-193 .P.L. 105-33 also established the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) grant program within TANF (funded at $3 billion over two years, FY1998 and FY1999), but administered by the Department of Labor at the federal level, with local administration by state workforce investment boards and competitive grantees.   P.L. 105-89 , enacted November 19, 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, reduced the contingency fund appropriation by $40 million.1998  P.L. 105-178 , enacted June 9, 1998, the Transportation Act for the 21 st Century, permitted the use of federal TANF funds as matching funds for reverse commuter grants.It also set the statutory limit on TANF transfers to Title XX social services at 4.25% of the block grant.
