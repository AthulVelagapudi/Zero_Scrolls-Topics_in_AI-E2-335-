Report:
Background  		 DODPublic Water Systems   DOD has two types of public water systems that provide drinking water to  people that live and work on military installations.The first type provides  drinking water that has been treated by DOD.  The second type provides  water treated by a private company or a local utility, which we refer to as  “non-DOD-treated” drinking water.  Drinking water systems vary by size  and other factors, but they most typically include a supply source,  treatment facility, and distribution system.  A water system’s supply source  may be a reservoir, aquifer, well, or a combination of these sources.The  treatment process for water generally uses, and remove and harmful agents  and disinfection processes such as chlorination to eliminate biological  contaminants.  Distribution systems are comprised of water towers, piping  grids, pumps, and other components to deliver treated water from  treatment systems to consumers.Drinking Water Regulations and Administrative Orders   EPA regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking  Water Act by issuing legally enforceable standards, known as National  Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which generally limit the levels of  these contaminants in public water systems.EPA has issued such  regulations for approximately 90 drinking water contaminants.  In  accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA may authorize a state  to have primary enforcement responsibility for drinking water regulations,  as long as the state has, among other things, drinking water regulations  that are no less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water  Regulations.  The Safe Drinking Water Act also authorizes EPA to take emergency  actions necessary to protect public health when informed that a  contaminant is present in or is likely to enter a public water system or an  underground source of drinking water that may present an imminent and  substantial endangerment.For example, EPA may issue administrative  orders, which generally include actions to be taken, such as remediating  contaminated sources of drinking water or requiring the provision of  alternative water supplies.  State regulators may also issue orders to  public water systems to address contaminated drinking water.  Public water systems, including the DOD public water systems that  provide drinking water to about 3 million people living and working on  military installations, are required to comply with EPA and state drinking  water regulations.EPA divides violations of drinking water regulations  into two types:  (1) health-based violations and (2) other types of  violations that include violations of monitoring, reporting, and public  notification requirements.  Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA also  is required to identify unregulated contaminants that present the greatest  health concern, establish a program to monitor drinking water for  unregulated contaminants, and decide whether or not to regulate at least  five such contaminants every 5 years.  EPA has not regulated any new  contaminants using this process since 1996.DOD’s environmental compliance policy states that ASD (EI&E) is  responsible for providing guidance, oversight, advocacy, and  representation for environmental compliance programs—to include  overseeing the military departments’ compliance with health-based  drinking water regulations at DOD public water systems.  The policy  directs the military departments to annually report to ASD (EI&E) the total  population receiving water from both “regulated” and “other” DOD public  water systems—referred to in this report as DOD public water systems  that provide DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water, respectively—  that did and did not attain all Safe Drinking Water Act health-based  drinking water standards.The policy also the military   to report information regarding each instance health-based   water not attained during the reporting period, to  include the name and location of the military installation;  the nature of the  issue (e.g., the contaminant type);  the DOD population affected;  the  duration of the issue;the corrective actions taken or planned (e.g.,  flushing the system, resampling the water, or implementing system  upgrades);  and the estimated date for achieving the standard.EPA Health Advisories   In addition to issuing drinking water regulations, EPA may also publish  drinking water health advisories.In contrast to drinking water regulations,  health advisories are nonenforceable.  Drinking water health advisories  provide technical guidance on health effects, analytical methodologies,  and treatment technologies.  These advisories recommend the amount of  these contaminants that can be present in drinking water—”health  advisory levels”—at which adverse health effects are not anticipated to  occur over specific exposure durations, to include 1 day, 10 days, several  years, or over a lifetime.  EPA issues provisional health advisories to  provide information in response to an urgent or rapidly developing  situation.DOD’s list of emerging contaminants includes 11  contaminants, including PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate, for which EPA  has issued a drinking water health advisory.  Specifically, PFOS.  PFOS is part of a larger group of fluorinated organic chemicals  that have been incorporated into an array of consumer products (i.e.,  to make some more resistant to stains, grease, and water) and also in  firefighting foam used by DOD and civilian airports.According to EPA,  the major manufacturer of PFOS in the United States voluntarily  agreed to phase out production of the chemical in 2002.  According to  EPA’s health advisory, exposure to PFOS may remain possible due to  legacy uses, existing and legacy use in imported goods, and the  chemical’s “extremely high persistence” in the environment.  According  to the EPA, exposure to PFOS may result in adverse health effects,  such as fetal developmental effects during pregnancy or to breastfed  infants, cancer, liver damage, immune effects, thyroid effects, and  other effects.  See table 1 for details of the EPA provisional health  advisory that was issued in 2009 and the lifetime health advisory that  was issued in 2016, which superseded the provisional health  advisory.PA.   ainated that in  generally the same products as PFOS, including firefighting foam  used by DOD and civilian airports.  According to EPA, PFOA was  voluntarily phased out by eight major companies in the manufacturing  of their products at the end of 2015.According to the EPA, adverse  health effects from exposure to PFOA are similar to those for PFOS.   See table 1 for details of the EPA provisional health advisory that was  issued in 2009 and the lifetime health advisory that was issued in  2016, which superseded the provisional health advisory.  Perchlorate.Per is in solid, ,, and someizers and been  used by DOD for fuel and  EPA published an   in 2008 the healthvisory at billion   the health  advisory, perchlorate can disrupt the functions of the thyroid gland.DOD-Identified Emerging ContaminantsIn 2009, DOD issued a policy on the identification, assessment, and risk  management of emerging contaminants that have the potential to impact  DOD.  According to that policy, chemicals and materials used or planned  for use by DOD that meet the definition of an emerging contaminant  should be identified as early as possible.  The policy further states that  DOD is to assess and, when appropriate, take action to reduce risks  posed by its emerging contaminants to people; the environment; and  DOD missions, programs, and resources.  Where necessary, DOD is to  perform sampling, conduct site-specific risk assessments, and take  response actions for emerging contaminants released from DOD facilities,  in accordance with relevant statutes. the DOD policy on emerging, ASD (EI is to   contaminants with potential or  bable high the departments and   of  April, contaminants comprised chemicals  or   to of EPA,  includes 21 contaminants that can be found in drinking water.Of these 21  cont, 10 contaminants been EPA the   Act and are currently unregulated   have EPA-issuedThe other 28  Didentified contaminants have EPA water  Appendix II provides information on  the drinking water regulatory status of DOD-identified emerging  contaminants.DOD Has Not Internally Reported All Data on Compliance with Drinking Water Regulations or Used Available Data to Evaluate Differences between Its Drinking Water SystemsFor the years we reviewed— years throughthe military  artments annually reported information internally to ASD (EI& on   with EPA and state water regulations,  which that water quality at DOD systems  was to other. , all  ations ofbased) during   time, as is by  The departmentsreported that of 77 military had violation at   point 2015, but we foundthat least 16 additional were to   but not  OD also not  used available identify why  that provide DOD- water have violations-based regulations than DOD systems that provide non-DOD- treated drinking water.Military Departments Have Internally Reported Data on Compliance with Health-Based Drinking Water Regulations, but Have Not Reported All ViolationsFor the years we reviewed—fiscal years 2013 through 2015—the military  departments annually reported information to ASD (EI&E) on compliance  with and violations of EPA and state health-based drinking water  regulations at the DOD public water systems that provide drinking water  to military installations.  The military departments’ data for fiscal years  2013 through 2015 indicate that about 92 percent of people who received  drinking water from DOD public water systems were served by a system  that complied with EPA and state health-based regulations.  This is similar  to the percentage of people in the United States—also about 92 percent,  according to EPA—who received drinking water during that time frame  from a community public water system with no health-based violations.The data for that period also that about of people  were provided water a DOD system that had at of abased regulation.  based violations  can be for any time during a year—, violation  lasting day is counted lasting for 1.    the 3, the military departments reported that of  77 violation at during that   period: 35 year, and fiscal.  The common of contaminants which military wereiform and twoionproducts— acids—which, to, are common contaminants which  based water occur the.However, we found that the military departments have not always  reported all violations to ASD (EI&E), as required by DOD policy.  Based  on our review of data in EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information System  for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, we found that the military departments  did not report violations to ASD (EI&E) for at least 16 installations—9 Air  Force installations, 5 Navy installations, and 2 Army installations.   According to EPA’s database, the total population served by DOD public  water systems at these installations is approximately 180,000 people, and  most of the violations that went unreported involved coliform and  disinfection byproduct contaminants.However, the actual population  number affected by these violations and the contaminants involved—  along with other information such as the duration of the contamination  and the corrective actions planned or taken—were not included in the  military departments’ annual reports to ASD (EI&E).  These violations  were recorded in EPA’s system, which indicates that the installations  reported the violations to the appropriate state regulatory agencies, who  then reported them to EPA’s database.  However, the violations were not  reported to ASD (EI&E), as required by DOD policy.According to military department officials, violations of health-based  drinking water regulations went unreported to ASD (EI&E) due to a lack of  clarity in DOD’s reporting requirements and misunderstandings of the  requirements on the part of installations and the military departments.  We  found that violations were either not reported by the military installations  where the violations occurred or that they were not reported by the  installations’ chains of command.  Navy officials cited turnover of  installation personnel as the reason some violations went unreported, as  well as misinterpretations by installation personnel of DOD’s reporting  requirements.Air Force officials also told us that most of their unreported  violations were not reported to ASD (EI&E) because the Air Force did not  interpret them as health-based violations, although DOD policy requires  these types of violations to be reported.  Army officials told us that,  based on their interpretation of DOD’s policy, the policy did not require  them to report violations at installations where formal, written notification  was not received from the state regulatory agency.  However, ASD (EI&E)  officials stated that all violations of health-based regulations should be  reported, whether or not the state provides formal, written notification of  the violation.  Navy officials also told us that they have not reported  violations at some of the Navy’s smaller systems that purchase drinking  water from non-DOD public water systems, due in part to  misinterpretation of DOD’s internal reporting requirements.However,  Navy officials told us that ASD (EI&E) had instructed them to begin  reporting these types of violations in fiscal year 2016, and the Navy is  working with ASD (EI&E) and the other military departments to determine  whether these types of systems should regularly report health-based  violations.  Currently, ASD (EI&E) does not have complete data in accordance with  DOD’s policy, limiting its ability to conduct oversight and analyze how  many people at military installations receive drinking water with health-  based violations, what contaminants were involved, the duration of the  contamination, or what corrective actions the military departments have  planned or taken to address the violation.Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government states that quality information is needed to  achieve an organization’s objectives.  Those standards also indicate that  actions such as improved communication to and additional training for  personnel are helpful for an organization to meet its objectives.   According to DOD officials, a committee comprised of ASD (EI&E) and  military department officials began a review in 2016 of DOD’s internal  reporting requirements for drinking water compliance data.  While such a  committee could be in a position to make recommendations on clarifying  the annual reporting requirements, no documentation on the committee’s  efforts was yet available at the time of our review as the committee’s work  was still in progress.In addition, at present, there are no firm dates for  when its work will be completed or when any potential changes would be  implemented.  Absent actions by ASD (EI&E) to identify and implement  any necessary changes to clarify annual reporting requirements in its  environmental compliance policy, and absent actions by the military  departments to increase understanding at their installations and  commands about the requirements, adherence to DOD’s environmental  compliance policy will remain limited and DOD will lack complete data to  conduct oversight of regulatory compliance at its public water systems.DOD Has Not Used Available Data to Assess  Why DOD-Treated Water Appears to Have More Health-Based Violations Than Non-DOD-Treated Drinking  WaterDOD has not used available data to assess why DOD public water  systems providing DOD-treated drinking water appear to have more  violations of health-based drinking water regulations than systems  providing non-DOD-treated drinking water.  Although we found that not all  violations were reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E), the  data that were reported during fiscal years 2013 through 2015 indicated  that about 99 percent of the people who received non-DOD-treated  drinking water were served by systems with no violations, while about 89  percent of the people who received DOD-treated drinking water were  served by systems with no violations.When we asked ASD (EI&E) and military department officials why these  differences may exist, they were unable to provide an explanation  because they had not used the reported water quality data to identify the  reasons why DOD public water systems providing DOD-treated water  appear to have more violations than systems providing non-DOD-treated  water.  Although some officials offered ideas on the reasons for  differences in compliance—including the relative expertise of utilities and  private companies, versus DOD, in providing drinking water—DOD  officials acknowledged that the agency has not evaluated the data to  identify specific reasons for why the differences may exist.  All public  water systems, including DOD public water systems, are required to  comply with applicable EPA and state drinking water regulations.   According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should establish and operate activities to monitor the  internal control system and evaluate the results.Such monitoring should   the of performance and promptly any .

DOD Is Taking Steps to Address Health and Environmental Concerns with Firefighting FoamThat Contains PFCs   DOD is taking steps to address PFOS- and PFOA-related health and  environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains  PFCs.Firefighting foam is used by DOD to put fires out quickly while  also ensuring that they do not reignite.  This is critical if, for example, there  is a fire from a fighter jet on the deck of an aircraft carrier.  DOD has  outlined performance requirements in its military specification for  firefighting foam, which was authored by the Navy’s Naval Sea Systems  Command but is approved for use in all of DOD.  For example, the  military specification states how long it should take for firefighting foam to  extinguish a fire—based on the size of the fire and the amount of foam  used—and how long the foam should prevent the extinguished fire from  reigniting.DOD’s military specification also requires that firefighting  foam purchased and used by the department must contain PFCs.  DOD’s steps to address concerns with the use of firefighting foam include  restricting the use of existing foams that contain PFCs; testing its current  foams to identify the amount of PFCs they contain; and funding research  into the future development of PFC-free foam that can meet DOD’s  performance and compatibility requirements (see table 2).  Some of these  steps, such as limiting the use of firefighting foam containing PFCs, are in  place.Others, such as determining the specific amount of PFCs in  existing firefighting foams or researching potential PFC-free firefighting  foams, are in progress with targets, in some cases, but no firm completion  dates.  Navy officials stated that they are planning to revise the military  specification after they have completed their testing—to be completed in  late 2017 or 2018—on the amounts of PFOS, PFOA, and other PFCs  found in the firefighting foam currently used by DOD.  That revision,  according to Navy officials, is intended to set limits for the amount of  PFCs that are allowed in firefighting foam.According to DOD, at present  there is no PFC-free firefighting foam that meets DOD’s performance and  compatibility requirements.  As a result, the Navy has no plans to remove  the requirement for firefighting foam to contain PFCs at this time.   However, if a PFC-free foam is developed in the future that can meet  DOD performance and compatibility requirements, Navy officials said that  any necessary revisions to the military specification would be made at  that time—a process that could take months to complete.DOD Has Responded to Orders from EPA and a State Regulator and Has Initiated Additional Actions to Address Elevated Levels of PFOS and PFOA in Drinking Water at or near Military InstallationsDOD has taken steps to respond to four administrative orders directing  the department to address PFOS and PFOA levels that exceeded EPA’s  health advisory levels for drinking water.  One order was issued by the  Ohio Environmental Protection Agency at Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base in Ohio, and three orders were issued by the EPA directed at:  the  former Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; Horsham Air Guard  Station in Pennsylvania; and  the former Naval Air Warfare Center  Warminster in Pennsylvania.Under Section 1431 of the Safe Drinking  Water Act, EPA may issue orders necessary to protect human health  where a contaminant in a public water system presents an imminent and  substantial endangerment.  EPA may do so if appropriate state and local  authorities have not acted to protect human health.  These orders may  require, among other things, carrying out cleanup studies, providing  alternate water supplies, notifying the public of the emergency, and  halting disposal of the contaminants threatening human health.  The Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency has similar authority.According to information provided by officials from the Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and DOD, DOD has taken steps  to respond to the administrative orders.  Table 3 provides further details  on each order and examples of actions by DOD to address the orders.In addition to actions specific to these four installations, DOD has initiated  other actions to test for, investigate, and mitigate elevated levels of PFOS  and PFOA at or near installations across the military departments.   Following the release of EPA’s lifetime health advisory for PFOS and  PFOA in May 2016, each of the military departments issued guidance  directing installations to, among other things, test for PFOS and PFOA in  their drinking water and take steps to address drinking water that  contained amounts of PFOS and PFOA above the EPA’s lifetime health  advisory level.  The military departments also directed their installations to  identify locations with a known or suspected prior release of PFOS and  PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health— which can include people living outside DOD installations.As a result of these efforts, DOD has initiated actions to address PFOS  and PFOA in drinking water both on military installations and outside  military installations.  As of March 2017, DOD data indicated that the  department was taking steps to address levels of PFOS and PFOA above  the EPA’s lifetime health advisory level in drinking water on 11 military  installations in the United States, 2 of which we visited during the course  of this review (see fig. 1).  According to DOD data, these installations took various corrective actions  to mitigate the presence of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water,  including shutting down drinking water wells, providing alternative drinking  water, and installing treatment systems.For example, at Eielson Air Force  Base in Alaska, the Air Force reported shutting down three of the  installation’s six drinking water wells and installing a treatment system to  remove PFOS and PFOA from the drinking water.  At Marine Corps Base  Camp Pendleton in California, the Navy reported that a well contaminated  with PFOS and PFOA was taken out of service and that the affected  reservoir was drained and replaced with water from another source;  follow-on testing showed that the presence of PFOS and PFOA were  returned to below the EPA’s lifetime health advisory level.  At Fort  Leavenworth in Kansas, the Army reported that the private company that  operates the installation’s drinking water system had shut down two wells  contaminated with PFOS and PFOA and plans to install a treatment  system before returning those wells to service.Additionally, according to DOD data as of December 2016 the military  departments had identified 391 active and closed installations with  known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA, and had reported  spending almost $200 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at or near 263 (or about 67 percent) of those  installations.  In particular, DOD had initiated mitigation actions, which  include installing treatment systems or supplying bottled water, to address  PFOS and PFOA in drinking water for people living outside 19  installations—5 of which we visited during the course of this review (see  fig. 2).  The following cost data provided by DOD were current as of December  2016, and are supplemented by additional information we obtained during  our installation visits.The Air Force identified 203 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $120 million on  environmental investigations at those installations, and spent about  $33 million on mitigation actions at or near 14 of the 203 installations.   For example, the Air Force reported spending over $5 million on  environmental investigations and mitigation actions at Peterson Air  Force Base in Colorado.  During our visit to that installation, officials  showed us the sites they are investigating—to include the current (see  fig. 3 below) and former fire training areas—to determine the extent to  which their prior use of firefighting foam may have contributed to the  discovery of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water of three nearby  communities.Additionally, the Air Force has awarded a contract for,  among other things, installing treatment systems in those  communities.  In another example, the Air Force reported spending  about $800,000 on environmental investigations at Joint Base  Langley-Eustis in Virginia, but nothing yet on mitigation actions.   During our visit to this installation, officials told us that they had not  taken any mitigation actions because they do not use the installation’s  groundwater as a drinking water source; the utility that serves the  installation, as well as the nearby city of Newport News, obtains its  drinking water primarily from a surface water source, which officials  said was approximately 20 miles from the installation.The Navy identified 127 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $20.5 million on  environmental investigations at 47 of those installations, and spent  about $24 million on mitigation actions at or near 5 of those  installations.  For example, the Navy reported spending about $15  million on environmental investigations and mitigation actions at the  former Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove in  Pennsylvania.  During our visit to this installation, officials told us that  the Navy is investigating the extent to which PFOS and PFOA on the  installation may have contaminated a nearby town’s drinking water.   The Navy has agreed to fund installation of treatment systems and  connections of private well owners to the town’s drinking water  system, among other things.In another example, the Navy reported  spending nearly $3 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress in  Virginia.  During our visit to this installation, officials told us that the  Navy is providing bottled water to the approximately 20 to 30  personnel who work there and plans to install a treatment system to  treat for PFOS and PFOA.  The Army identified 61 installations with known or suspected releases  of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $1.6 million on environmental  investigations at 13 of those installations, and has not yet begun any  mitigation actions at or near the identified installations.For example,  the Army reported spending about $26,000 on environmental  investigations at Fort Carson in Colorado, but nothing yet on  mitigation actions.  During our visit to this installation, officials told us  that they had found PFOS and PFOA in groundwater near their  previous fire training area but that the installation does not use that  groundwater as a drinking water source, and state officials told us that  it is unlikely that PFOS and PFOA from Fort Carson had affected any  nearby drinking water sources.  According to DOD, it may take several years for the department to  determine how much it will cost to cleanup PFOS and PFOA  contamination at or near its military installations.In January 2017, we  reported that DOD had not notified Congress that the costs for  environmental cleanup at closed installations will significantly increase  due to the high cost of remediating emerging contaminants—including  PFOS and PFOA.  We also reported that DOD officials had not  determined the total costs for cleaning up emerging contaminants at  closed installations.  We recommended that DOD include in future annual  reports to Congress best estimates of the environmental cleanup costs for  emerging contaminants as additional information becomes available, and  DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated its commitment to  do so.DOD Previously Directed Installations to Test for Perchlorate in Drinking WaterDOD previously directed installations to test for perchlorate in drinking  water.  Following the EPA’s issuance of an interim drinking water health  advisory for perchlorate in 2008, DOD issued policy in April 2009—which  superseded similar policy that was issued in January 2006—directing  DOD-owned drinking water systems that were testing for inorganic  substances to also test for perchlorate.  Installations that found  perchlorate in their drinking water were to consult with their leadership on  appropriate actions to take and to continue testing on a quarterly basis  until they determined that perchlorate levels were likely to remain below  EPA’s health advisory level, or any applicable federal or state regulation.   Citing congressional and regulatory agency concerns related to  perchlorate, DOD developed a database for storing the results of  perchlorate testing.According to ASD (EI&E), the database was last  updated in 2009 and is no longer being used by the department.  ASD (EI&E) officials stated that they are no longer regularly testing  drinking water for perchlorate unless there is a state requirement to do so;  previous testing indicated that DOD was not a primary source of  perchlorate in drinking water and that known releases of perchlorate did  not currently pose a threat to drinking water.  According to EPA, the  agency expects to issue a final drinking water regulation for perchlorate  by the end of 2019.ASD (EI&E) officials told us that, once EPA has  issued a final regulation, DOD is committed to complying with it.  	 ConclusionsDuring the period we reviewed, DOD data indicate that DOD public water  systems complied with EPA and state health-based drinking water  regulations at a level comparable with other systems in the United States.   However, we found that the military departments did not report all  violations of these regulations to ASD (EI&E) during that period, which  illustrates that DOD’s internal reporting requirements for drinking water  data are either not clear in DOD regulations or are not clearly understood  by those implementing them.  Unless ASD (EI&E) and the military  departments act to make any necessary clarifications to and increase  understanding of DOD’s annual reporting requirements, ASD (EI&E) may  not have complete data to effectively oversee the military departments’  compliance with drinking water regulations.Further, the data indicated  that systems providing DOD-treated drinking water had more reported  health-based violations than DOD systems providing non-DOD-treated  drinking water.  However, DOD has not used these data to identify the  reasons that these differences may exist.  Without using available data to  identify why differences in violations appear to exist between DOD’s two  types of public water systems, DOD will likely be hampered in its ability to  identify what actions, if any, could be taken to address any differences  and improve overall compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations.Recommendations for Executive ActionWe are a of five to DOD.The for andEnvironment, the the military should and implement any toOD’s environmental compliance policy to clarify DOD’s reporting  requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations.   (Recommendation 1)The Secretary of the Army should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Army installations and commands about  DOD’s reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking  water regulations.  These actions may include improved communication to  or additional training for personnel.  (Recommendation 2)The Secretary of the Navy should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Navy installations and commands about DOD’s  reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking water  regulations.  These actions may include improved communication to or  additional training for personnel.  (Recommendation 3)The Secretary of the Air Force should identify and implement actions to  increase understanding at Air Force installations and commands about  DOD’s reporting requirements for violations of health-based drinking  water regulations.  These actions may include improved communication to  or additional training for personnel.  (Recommendation 4)The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military  departments, should (a) review reported compliance data to identify the  reasons for any differences in the number of violations of health-based  drinking water regulations between DOD’s two types of public water  systems and  (b) identify and implement any actions needed to address  the causes of any differences in the number of violations between DOD’s  two types of public water systems.  (Recommendation 5)Agency Comments and Our EvaluationWe provided a draft of this report to DOD and EPA for review and  comment.  In its written comments, reproduced in appendix III, DOD  concurred with our recommendations.  DOD and EPA also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.Based on  technical comments from DOD, we revised the title of the report to more  clearly specify the actions DOD should take to address the findings in our  report.  We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Energy, Installations, and Environment; the Secretaries of the Army,  the Navy, and the Air Force; and the Administrator of EPA.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix IV.Appendix I:  Objectives, Scope, and MethodologySenate Report 114-255 accompanying a bill for the national defense  authorization for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for us to review the  Department of Defense’s (DOD) efforts to manage contaminants in  drinking water.  This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1)  internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations at military installations and used those data to assess  compliance at its two types of public water systems and (2) taken actions  to address concerns with its firefighting foam containing perfluorinated  chemicals (PFCs) and to address elevated levels of  perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and  perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations.For objective one, we reviewed DOD’s policy on environmental  compliance in the United States, which directs the military departments to  annually report data to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment (ASD (EI&E)) on compliance with and  violations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state health-  based drinking water regulations at military installations.  We analyzed  data reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E) on compliance  with and violations of health-based drinking water regulations at DOD  public water systems located at military installations in the United States  for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the most recent data available at the  time of our review.We analyzed the data to identify (1) the number of  people served by DOD public water systems that complied with  applicable EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations during  the fiscal year and (2) the number of people served by DOD public water  systems that violated at least one of these regulations sometime during  the fiscal year.  We performed this analysis for both types of DOD public  water systems—those that provide DOD-treated drinking water, and  those that provide non-DOD-treated drinking water.  We also used the  data to identify the military installations where the reported violations  occurred; the nature of the violation (including the contaminant involved);  and the number of people affected.  Next, we collected data from EPA’s  Safe Drinking Water Information System for all public water systems in  the United States.We used DOD-provided public water system  identification numbers to identify in the EPA system any violations for  health-based drinking water regulations at those DOD systems for fiscal  years 2013 through 2015.  We then compared the violations found in  EPA’s data to the data reported by the military departments to ASD  (EI&E) to determine the extent to which the military departments were  reporting all violations of health-based drinking water regulations to ASD  (EI&E).  We also analyzed DOD’s data to identify any differences in violations  between DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water.We the  military departments� reported data ands of to  mine withs requirements the  s environmental compliance instruction and .   to these, quality is to achieve, management is to monitor performance  ly any findings and actions as  communication to and for are helpful for to also discussed our  D (EI& and officials and discussed   for why any violationsported to and why   be in between DOD-- treatedWe the DOD anddata on ofbased drinking water regulations by reviewing  relevant documentation, testing the data for obvious errors, and  interviewing knowledgeable officials.As we have previously found, EPA’s  data system may not contain all public water violations as states have  under-reported the violations.  During this review, we found that some  public water system identification numbers for DOD installations could not  be matched with EPA’s system and, therefore, were excluded from our  analysis.  As a result, some DOD installation violations may be missing  from the data, and we may not have comprehensive violations data for  health-based drinking water regulations at DOD installations.   Nonetheless, we determined that DOD and EPA data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of identifying whether any drinking water  violations were recorded in EPA’s system but not internally reported  within DOD, and to indicate possible differences in drinking water  violations, as reported by the military departments, between DOD’s two  types of public water systems.For objective two, we reviewed policies issued by the military  departments on the use of firefighting foam that contains PFCs.  We also  reviewed DOD documents related to research into PFC-free firefighting  foams that can meet the department’s performance and compatibility  requirements, as well as DOD’s military specification document that  outlines those requirements.  We met with officials from ASD (EI&E) and  the military departments to discuss their policies on the use of firefighting  foam and actions taken to address concerns with the use of firefighting  foam containing PFCs, including the future use of firefighting foam.Additionally, we met with Navy officials responsible for testing existing  firefighting foam products and setting the military specifications for  firefighting foam use in DOD.  Additionally, we obtained and reviewed four regulatory administrative  orders—three from EPA and one from the Ohio Environmental Protection  Agency—directing DOD to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA  contamination in drinking water at or near four active and closed military  installations, and reviewed documentation related to DOD’s efforts to  address these administrative orders.  We also met with officials from Ohio  and the EPA regions that issued the orders—EPA Regions 1 and 3—as  well as DOD officials who responded to the orders, to discuss DOD’s  response to the orders.We reviewed water guidance by  ASD (EI&E and the military departments on testing drinkingA and to suspected .We analyzed DOD- on the  ations where DOD-ed testing showed water the EPA level  for those contaminants ( of March 2017 and the costs and actions to andA at near militaryations ofWe the thedata by the data for data, where other information collected,and by interviewing knowledgeable officials we found be   purposes of describing has reportedon its actions costs for responding to PFOS and PFOA.Additionally, we reviewed DOD policy and our prior work on testing for  and responding to perchlorate at military installations.  We met with ASD  (EI&E) and military department officials to discuss DOD actions to  address PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate.  To obtain additional information  on DOD actions to address emerging contaminants in drinking water, we  conducted site visits to a nongeneralizable sample of seven current and  former military installations—at least two installations per military  department—that were selected because they were investigating or  responding to unregulated DOD-identified emerging contaminants in  drinking water; these installations are listed below.  We also met with  EPA and state regulatory officials to better understand how DOD was  responding to administrative orders and addressing PFOS, PFOA, and  perchlorate at or near DOD installations.Specifically, we met with officials  from selected EPA regions and state regulatory offices that had issued an  administrative order for PFOS and PFOA or whose region or state  included the installations we visited; those EPA regions and states are  listed below.  We also compared DOD’s list of emerging contaminants with  EPA documentation to determine how many DOD-identified emerging  contaminants (1) have been regulated by EPA under the Safe Drinking  Water Act or (2) are currently unregulated but have an EPA-issued  drinking water health advisory.  We visited or contacted the following offices and locations during our  review.Unless otherwise specified, these organizations are located in or  near Washington, D.C.
