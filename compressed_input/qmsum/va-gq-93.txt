Lynne Neagle  AM:  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee.We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today.  Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please?  No.  Okay. Thank you very much.Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer.  So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years.  So, thank you, all, for your attendance.  If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.Hefin David  AM: Good morning, Minister.  How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?Huw-ies AM:'s gone but'm it through process of earlyer, actually, we're learning.  It has been, to're're expanding've made announcements on expanding the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons.But, in of're, one is the bureaucracy the current approach,'s done the seven early.'re asking to, their provide the 're dealing parents families with issues and complex'sAnd the of administration on is falling to each pilot area.In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one—that's in Blaenau Gwent.  In others, it's smaller areas.  So, we're also hitting those—.  The other big challenge we're hitting is communication.So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging.  But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?'  'Well, you're not in the pilot area.'  So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.Hefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: is that sheer burden on each authority, and each pilot, to administer a scheme where are asking to prove, to in documents prove to make adjustments as goes forward on what their changing, their salary slips say. 's incredibly  So,, we the statement the the thecare Funding ( we made that our option, as put within that framework is to on to from the lessons as well the model the HM Customs of where you have—and this, is by local authority providers—one is a where is clarity, is handled that has of sharing between Government, and, that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.Hefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  We are very confident.But, as I,'m more the're actuallying it andasing, because've from the experiences elsewhere, including just in they a different of a childcare,'ve gone for a bigbang.And it has to, to, where their of would was the actually then forward and the complexity, I of individual, whereas we doing, He is taking this forward  Eachout each expansion doing the pilot is not— I know this has some to come 'Why we it 're only out to we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within densely urban areas, where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it.'ve the whole offer across Gedd, and Ca.  Flshire a-. ondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September.  Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course—in short order—as well.So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.  Hefin David AM:  Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.  Hefin David AM: And why is that?Is that to problem across?  wies:'t. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues.  So,there are issues to do with—.It's not capacity, by the way.  We're not finding a problem here with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding that as an issue.  But what we are finding is, for example, one of the well-known ones—and I've spoken about this before—is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families.  I've done it myself.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered, unlicensed childcare of a sort.  Now that isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I have to say.  So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with parents and providers and local authorities as well.  So, we have a whole programme running alongside it.'s about communicating the how  get inv in this and  they to and,, how we that nationalout be important.  Hin David , the about  and, be sensible, to aparents to provide this kind of care?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Unregistered grandparents?  Hefin David AM: Well, through some kind of analysis of that.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this.  Hefin David AM: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as carers for their own family member?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that registration as well.  The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects that come with this.  This childcare offer ties into the foundation years offer.'s an of education the care offer—'s that 10 of the education foundation years.The two an issue with, about and as to purelyas as all our and—simply child-minding.  That's one important distinction. the  this is on registered licensed which be, way— we have we're this moment internally the Professional Association—parents are and pected the careorate? 're having   Hin David: How many of them are there?Huw-ies AM: We't think a huge number we're to bottom out.We gotthe we think but are in our, registered,, inspected who after other children a little group of seven, but also their own grandchildren.Hefin David AM: ,'re a of grandparents . that I say you that Darren this the floor yesterday as well—is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles.I that as well because we also get  who say't be for my grandchildren I grandchildren I them'.  Hin David AM:  And what the view, you that was't, the National that the most fragile in Great Britain?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an opportunity to make it more resilient and more robust.  We know from the early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity within the childcare sector, and we're talking about everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children, to large, complex environments that perhaps are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation.  So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer.What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by £60 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare—and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well—that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff.  In other areas, we're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities.  We've got to get it right.Hefin David AM:  That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product?  Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing?Huw-ies AM:, think is, absolutely, because,,'re is we got several on once of we and the developmentof this.   the doing the the,'re literally learning live time, and I have much weeklyly on, also a termly update 've also commissioned work from Arad at this firstout done to what that us as  But the the providers, the basis're now identifying where the gaps the the physical that, we can this', because're the we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales.It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden—flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.'  So, let me give you one key example.  Alongside this, alongside the £60 million capital fund, alongside the workforce development, we've also identified a separate strain of money into cylch meithrin.  We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development.'re specifically into developing that and first one of those will be, from that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September.  They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by—  Jo-Anne Daniels:Thirty.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years after that.We can't take this for granted, Hefin.  This is difficult.  This is hard work, but we have everything in place to make it happen.Hefin David AM:The last thing from the £.50 single national rate— a be a ofstyle nursery provision the parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because of the add-ons?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities.  The first thing to say is the £4.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity and confusion.  Hefin David AM:Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, because we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point.Hefin David AM: Okay, fair enough.  But will it be, then?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, it will be.Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them.  But, as I say—  Hefin David AM:But you anticipatea capacity the £.50 in, to theon?  wies: We'tit H's for going into that area and then assessing how it works.  We're reasonably confident that the £4.50—.We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the £4.50 might work as a universal amount.  But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach.  So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the £4.50 amount has been welcomed—it's appropriate.  You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the £4.50, because the £4.50 doesn't cover everything.The £4.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover—and we agonised over this—the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this.  Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are.  I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.  One: parents are quite used to—with childcare settings and play care settings and so on—the idea that providers are quite different.Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents—and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now—'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on.  Hefin David AM:  That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't.Isn't that a concern?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well.The that parents, are on are to currently between, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'—  Hefin David AM:  That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money—'You can do what you want'—I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions.  It says, 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer. You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer.But within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, "Within that we provide everything"; you may be with a provider that says, "Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost—".'  Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually—the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily disadvantage.  In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges?  Well, possibly you would.But we work within the realistic—  Hefin David AM:  Or have a lower top-end income limit.Huw-ies AM:   how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted.  For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying:one—'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity.  But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents—and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here—there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying,  'Well, let's take the upper limit down to £80 or £60 or £55.'  There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity.We have looked at it.  Lynne Neagle AM:  Darren on this.renar AM:  Just to, I, the market are,   the wage increasing—.]—that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the £4.50 per hour regime?By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that £4.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example.  Do you have plans to review that?  Where is it headed?  Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future.Huw-ies AM:  It depends how far you  I have, the feedback're having moment from organisations the Professional Years and the Association Wales others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable future of rolling this out.Darren Millar AM:  But they've raised concerns about the national living wage implications, haven't they, as well?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not—  Darren Millar AM:  So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised.  Darren Millar AM: But they have suggested that in meetings—Huw Irranca-Davies AM: That in future—  Darren Millar AM: Absolutely.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at—is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well?  And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward.  But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount.Darren Millar AM: So, have you forecasted for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project?  Because you've still got this £100 million price tag on it, haven't you?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's—.  I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little.  But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability within the English rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed.  If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case.Darren Millar AM:  But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn—the Arad report coming forward—that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this—challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it—but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate—the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that £100 million figure—it's deliverable within that.  But if it changes, we will come back.  And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it.  But at this moment, we have confidence and we've run the rule across this repeatedly.But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer—there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out.  Lynne Neagle AM:  Mark on this.Mark Reckless AM:  Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for £27, which is implied by your rate.  Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work?Isn't that already obvious?  Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:Chair, my is a who's actually this area but, been myself—.   you be,'s're and why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the £4.50 per hour rate.  Mark Reckless AM:But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  No. We will be.We are going to be.  Mark Reckless AM: When are you starting?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Cardiff and Newport—September.  Owain Lloyd: This September.Mark Reckless AM: This September?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. So, we're not missing any of these learning experiences and we know that—.The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way—please take this back to any authorities affected—is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding the cultural and the economic impacts.  So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision.  But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it.  And do you know, you may be right?And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee.  But let's go in and learn it first of all, rather than assume it necessarily.  Lynne Neagle AM:Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable items, your paper says that providers can charge up to £7.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies.  Now, that's £37.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?  But also, do you think there's a risk that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme.  I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that—whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening.  We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families., the early evaluation,, will us good on.   think, that providers that a effort to this   not in their interests, I, as the umbrella bodies or to as some way canuly in additional income from this of poorer   is about providing opportunities for all working families.But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts—in the early evaluation—are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales.  That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons.  So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that.Lynne Neagle AM:  John on this.  John Griffiths AM:I want to come back to the £4.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that £4.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity?  Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well.  This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time.  It's not only the geographical diversity—it's the diversity of the sector itself.  I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have.Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well.  Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that £4.50 rate.  That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it.  I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay?But,'s that open dialogue the that ''s thing about're saying you demand a market saying we have affordability from money to actually this'.  They also understand, that as as an enabling policy're seeing the evidence, way; I can—of individuals are being into more flexible options to get, and, about building in a fundamental foundation is in single of  The being debatedam here the Assembly about foundational—  The sector itself that we the childcare in its, including,, the but and, as inath and elsewhere that I was involvedin 30-odd years ago setting up—that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well.They know that.  They know there is job creation within this and there's economic impact for that.  So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with £4.50.'Lynne Neagle AM:  David, you had a question on the pilots.  David Rees AM:, just to finish that section, if may,.   I to my I to to Mark's question the answerI that if a to at different rates the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate.  Is that also on the cards?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  David, it's possible.  I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's—.There's real simplicity and it's been welcomed in the sector.  But the sector, also, are quite pragmatic about this.  One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision.  If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it.But first of all, I think we have to go in and see how does this work.  We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the £4.50 per hour works in supporting provision there.  David Rees AM:Okay. In your answer to John, you talked about affordability, which I totally understand.  If I can now remind you:  I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government.  It was 'we will offer childcare facilities'.So, I just want to put a reminder to you there.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Ministers always look at affordability.David Rees AM:  Well, voters don't.  In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity.Workforce capacity you've mentioned.  To actually be registered need staff are qualified 's to staff, because in your own the report in 2016 said you the capacity in Wales   you that can actually the workforce that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well?Because there's a clear need to look at it.  You talk about 30 by 2020.  By the way, 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales.  Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open.  This is challenging.This is.  To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge.  Can we do it?  Yes we can.And I't that.   me suggest some the ways   have that can this if is together across the sector, across the local authorities.  Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities—all of this.First of all, this is being—.  The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced.  We're working through it.  We're working through it with the sector.So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward.  We've engaged with the 22 authorities—not just the pilot areas as well on this.  So, beyond the pilot areas, we also have intense engagement.  As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are.David Rees AM:  What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward?Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Well, it's precisely that.  So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are.  Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints.But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out.  They're not being left out of this.  And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out.  We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision.So, we're doing that already.  We are looking as well, as this is rolled out, around the issue of co-location.  Now, co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development.  It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another.So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that:  where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it?  If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that?  So, we're doing that at the moment.I mentioned we've put the1 million the meithrin, targeting 40 newmedium groups by, which much the of this. 's the of additional 150 next decade of, of things,, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place.David Rees AM:  But in particular, take the Welsh language—I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time—but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas.  When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically.  They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. you been to the impact,, the Welsh-medium of things?  Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:Absolutely.  We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision—meithrin and so on—but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive.  So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer.  They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision.David Rees AM:  And that's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities.Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Absolutely the same.  Absolutely the same.  And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located.But the provision should be there.  This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas.  Lynne Neagle AM:I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question.  Llyr.  Llyr Gruffydd AM:I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may.  Lynne Neagle AM: Okay.Lrdd AM:.  The in merin, is we all  A question from me, the question is: we mainstream Welsh medium into ,, to is there of existing infrastructure toskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium.So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that—that there is a challenge there.  Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector.  So, it wasn't a question after all.  So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost.But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted., the of different choices they making be to the of hours're in, they a choice, not constrained to hours or, they a, with wider of're that decision're to.  Some,, Lr, I have sayand,, are reallife—are 'What is not but, the increased childcare increased offer we to actually're hours work, the provision.'  That itself I a worthy.  But I say we found out, inlife examples— that in direct what that paper—Llyr Gruffydd AM:  That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong.Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October—we're hoping to see the final report in October—will help put some flesh on this as well.  It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more.  So, it's having a positive effect.I can cite you examples,'ve asked my own officials, of who're to £ on the this offer the, who've their've to their work life, their. 's real, to—yes.  Llyr Gruffydd AM:, in, are the PPIW report, basically.  wies AM  No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this.It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those.  And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment—maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.'  Llyr Gruffydd AM:But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  We know, and we are constantly told—I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well—by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them.We are picking up, even from the early term of the analysis—.  I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more.  It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer.  So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report.It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through.  As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding.  We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, "Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well."'Llyr Gruffydd AM:  Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales.  I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera.Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate—do some appropriate benchmarking.  What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand.  They're in quite similar contexts.But we will do, L, arounding against good comparative, where.  rdd AM , there, because of the in the the OECD report are forought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples.  We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed.  There is a direct outcome there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.'Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address.  Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life.  I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged—those from workless households—are being excluded from this policy.Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now.  It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability.But it't the that we took forward into Government; we're.   is interesting  of that of families then whoI say two things on, this't alone as hours of childcare.  Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody.But before, particularly for those disadvantaged, before we even to that, you have schemes as, and I know this has looked in at Start and has it would it out.  If I had money would really that, Chair would really do it.  But I don't have all the money under the sun.Lrdd AM:  But you the to the  : the that Start, we is to those outcomes where children in quite circumstances are more to the foundation, ready, step into mainstream education in later years—those things tie together.So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare.  That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents.  And we don't think that that's a bad thing.  In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare.Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.'  Llyr Gruffydd AM:  The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed.  Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme—it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different forms.  It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work.  So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. you the support the, we got the 10 hours that sits the the education, got other family intervention that help with social, and on.   at this solely on own and, there is nothing else there; the of is a desert for parents, for getting work or for those are not seeking to work but need support and for children in', I'd beBut,, this fits theigsaw Wales, where we are the other   we, I,lyr; I, that if had—I have aebook at, because not in my gift—if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't.But what we is get the right and if this helps drive more for, including, way—.  are niceties within this well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working.  You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit.  You could have a parent who is a registered carer.They would qualify for the scheme.  Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about.  So, there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families.Lynne Neagle AM:  Darren on this.  Darren Millar AM:I am surprised by the answer there, particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old.  Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that.  If I can just very quickly ask you:  has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week?So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there?  Huw Irranca-Davies  AM:Darren, we have considered we't it the scheme because is to enable to go work, not into training to enable them to get into work.  There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme.  Darren Millar AM:But it's not prescribed support, is it?  You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier.  You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my left and my right.  Owain Lloyd: Not at this point.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't—  Darren Millar AM: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We have actually considered—.  We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?'  It's very clear.  When we ran, in the manifesto on this point—Darren Millar AM: I understand that. I don't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock.  But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved—Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Absolutely, absolutely.  Darren Millar AM:And therefore you've not considered be affordable in the policy objective that is.  wies AM:,, right affordability've it on principles to with what thisIt doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings?Darren Millar AM: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way.  Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Ah, right, okay. We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the scheme is designed to do.  Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?  I drew attention in my answer to Llyr to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.  In Gwynedd, one of our pilot areas, they are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. what is the support around.   not the case you've suggested that is somehow more disadvantage being on other  What is tie in in those pilot the existing and's the way to it , I want to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families.Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.  All families will qualify for the 10 hours of education.  In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer—Darren Millar AM:  But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start—  Darren Millar AM:  But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family—  Darren Millar AM: If they're in a Flying Start area.Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  —or they can be in a children's zone area or they can—Darren Millar AM: If they're in those areas.  Lynne Neagle AM: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please.Johns AM:,,.   of child and how this with wider  Government,  Huw, I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.  We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government.They've about the qualifications the the quality.  I just wonder how that sits within the £4.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that:  I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward—a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but what they were doing was—.  Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects—.  So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that., that the to see the £.50 to work, at for.  It interesting, we discussed, as it goes forward— at that,But the quality is're focused on registered providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet.John Griffiths AM:  If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the £4.50 rate.Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant—.  It's interesting that we focus on whether the £4.50 is affordable, but the £4.50—you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that £4.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous.  So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff?, we're some work that think I've to this before about the years development entirely. , is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that.  How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development?  It's not simply childcare.Lynne Neagle AM:  Okay. Thank you.  Right.The next questions are from Mark.  Mark Reckless AM:  In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas.There of that they start a disadvantage at and't make that up, even as they go through school.  What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:I'm looking to my colleagues here and—  Jo-Anne Daniels:  Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer.Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born, but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether—.  There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children.  Mark Reckless AM:Well, they do have flexibility. You don't have to start your kids until the term following when they're five.  That's the compulsory school—  Jo-Anne Daniels:,'s the legal but,,, most children will school the they're.  Markless AM , the disadvantage we that the children,, why that by giving the older kids five of this which you will have such their, but the summer kids only get three?Does't that make the?  JoAnne Daniels: I not sure the.  So, children will stop being in receipt of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday.Mark Reckless AM:  But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely.  Could more thought be given to this issue?Huw Irranca-Davies  AM: We'll take that away. It's confused us a little bit, but we'll take that away. We might need to come back to you and—.  Yes.Lynne Neagle AM: If you could write to us about that, that would be helpful.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes.Markless AM:. , you got, or,, got the Public Institute to this proposed they would no substantial on net, or work behaviour for children that the on work participation and for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small.  What do you say to that?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what I said earlier.  Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier, up to £250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples—but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.Lynne Neagle AM:  And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.  Mark Reckless AM:I understand. 's not myI just the of this PPIW of work.  They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement.Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement.  I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM: not quite comparing like.   to attention, Mark, and the to that the PPIW was a of 38   aweek the are having parents already saying that their to actually that the weeks— the term time and—ries are not picked up in that report.Mark Reckless AM:  And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it's around about 60 per cent of families are those.  We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes.  It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered.  So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.Mark Reckless AM:  And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is.  The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had.  That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every—Markless AM:I wonder, whether doing in a very good way, to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:You're right—sorry.  That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit.  There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion.  So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.Mark Reckless AM:  So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap, as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are?  Because we've been looking, say, at the £7.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that.So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?  Huw Irranca-Davies AM:  Yes, absolutely.And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.  Owain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC.  So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer.But,,'re not at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.  Mark Reckless AM: Thank you.Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.  Okay. Well, we have come to—well, we've run over, actually.  So, we've come to the end of our time.  Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending?You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then.  You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice.  But thank you again, all of you.Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely.  Thank you—diolch yn fawr.  Lynne Neagle AM:Okay, item 3 then is papers to note.  As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note.  So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay.  Yes, okay. Thank you.Item 4, then.  Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting?  Are Members content?  Okay. Thank you.... [The rest of the transcript is omitted]
