The b  Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.  And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.So {vocalsound}  now we have to think about what we will make.  First I wanna hear from you.  Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.So {disfmarker}  Industrial Designer:  Uh I will start.Project Manager: F first {gap}  .Industrial Designer:  Uh {disfmarker}  {gap}Marketing: {vocalsound}  Industrial Designer:  Big one, they are uh not easy to use.Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.  So that won't be uh our goal, I think.  User Interface: No.Industrial Designer:  And uh g big buttons,  {vocalsound}m uh that's easier to use than uh  {disfmarker}  I think.  Not all the small buttons, you don't know {disfmarker}Project Manager: Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?  Industrial Designer:Big buttons, positive.  Project Manager:  Positive.Industrial Designer:  All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.Project Manager: Okay.  What are your experiences?  User Interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set.Project Manager: Mm.  User Interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume.And uh I's positive a a LED the the the remote. it s it still it {disfmarker} in it.  And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.  And uh yeah.Uh {disfmarker}  Project Manager: So and do they always have that?User Interface: Yeah, but {disfmarker}  No no no.  But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.Project Manager: It's easy to you.  User Interface: Yeah.  Yeah.Project Manager: Okay.  'Kay.Marketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_, a video uh recorder, a D_V_D_ player, and a satellite receiver.  We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.  Industrial Designer:{vocalsound}  Thank you.  Marketing: That's not really ea easy.Industrial Designer: Help also.  {vocalsound}  Thank you.Marketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all.  And we also had a remote control for our radio set.  But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.And it was uh uh v {vocalsound}  not easy to use.  So we n barely used it.Project Manager: Okay so they have too much.  So next.  User Interface: Hmm.Project Manager:  For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.  So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?What what does it have to have?  {vocalsound}  Industrial Designer: The weight.Not not too heavy.  Project Manager: Not too heavy.  Yes.Industrial Designer: Not much buttons.  Project Manager: Yeah.Industrial Designer:  Bust-free.  That when you drop it, it won't break.Like uh some kind of rubber on it.  Or hard uh hard plastic.  Uh buttons not too small.  Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.  Project Manager: Yes.Industrial Designer:  When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some {gap}  {disfmarker}  uh some sort of bleep.User Interface:  {vocalsound}Project Manager: Like a phone.  Industrial Designer:  And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.Project Manager: Okay.  Marketing: Yeah.Industrial Designer:  {vocalsound}User Interface: {vocalsound}  Yeah.  Industrial Designer:{vocalsound}  Project Manager: So,Industrial Designer:  Next.  Project Manager: that's {gap}.  User Interface: Yeah well that's {disfmarker}  that are good ideas.Uh {disfmarker}  Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.  If you push a button.  Um {disfmarker}Yeah.  And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.  So probably plastic or something.  Uh {disfmarker}Project Manager: Okay.  Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}Marketing: Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker}  from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.  Or you won't sell it.Project Manager: Yes.  Marketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.  Project Manager: Okay.  This is {disfmarker}It has to be compatible with other things.  Marketing: Yes.Project Manager: Okay.  Industrial Designer: I have one more idea.  Just popped up.Project Manager: Yes?  Industrial Designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.So you don't {disfmarker}  won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.  Project Manager: No battery use.So more ideas?  User Interface: Mm no.Project Manager: No okay.  It's only the first ideas.  So {vocalsound}  uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker}Next meeting is in half an h hour.  Uh {disfmarker}  {vocalsound}  Okay.Next meeting, half an hour.  Um, what you have to do.
